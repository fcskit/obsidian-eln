The **general linear model** or **general multivariate regression model** is a compact way of simultaneously writing several [multiple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_linear_regression "Multiple linear regression") models. In that sense it is not a separate statistical [linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model "Linear model"). The various multiple linear regression models may be compactly written as $Y=XB + U$

The general linear model incorporates a number of different statistical models: ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA, ordinary linear regression, _t_-test and _F_-test. The general linear model is a generalization of multiple linear regression to the case of more than one dependent variable. If **Y**, **B**, and **U** were column vectors, the matrix equation above would represent multiple linear regression.

Hypothesis tests with the general linear model can be made in two ways: multivariate or as several independent univariate tests. In multivariate tests the columns of **Y** are tested together, whereas in univariate tests the columns of **Y** are tested independently, i.e., as multiple univariate tests with the same design matrix.

> [!multi-column]
>> [!NOTE]+ How to use?
>> - To achieve this note layout, download `MCL Multi Column.css` to your snippets. It uses the following custom callout to achieve the look
>> 	- `[!blank-container|right-medium]` - to float to the right
>> 	- `[!multi-column]` with dataview code blocks inside - to achieve the three column dataview
> 
>> [!Warning]+ Compatibility issue with some themes
>> - The float does not work well with blockquotes and callout box formatting. It depends on the theme developer way of formatting them
>>> Example here uses **Mado 11** theme by *hydescarf*. No changes made to theme (in term of color, formatting and decoration) other than the layout. MCL is meant to be used in tandem with most community theme.
