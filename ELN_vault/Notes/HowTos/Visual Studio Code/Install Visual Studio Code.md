## Setup Windows PowerShell for VS Code

VS Code on windows uses the default Windows PowerShell as terminal (not the Anaconda PowerShell). This may cause problems since the default PowerShell cannot display the active python environment. To setup up the VS Code PowerShell for *Anaconda* or *miniconda* open the standard Windows PowerShell and execute:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`

Followed by:
`conda init powershell`

If you get an error that the PowerShell cannot locate *conda* you will have to add the installation path of your conda installation to your user PATH variable. Afterwards execute the `conda init powershell` command again.

#### Adding the conda path to your User PATH variable
1. Type `variable` in the search field of your Windows task bar.
2. Choose `Edit environment variables for this account`

4. Press `New` to add a new path.

5. Type in the root directory to your anaconda or miniconda installation. Assume you installed miniconda3 into your local user folder under AppData\\Local\\miniconda3 you need to add `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\miniconda3`
6. Do the same for the subdirectories
   `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\miniconda3\Skripts`  and
   `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\miniconda3\Library\bin`
7. Log off or restart your computer.

3. If you want to execute python code interactively also install the Jupyter Extension to obtain support for Jupyter notebooks.
