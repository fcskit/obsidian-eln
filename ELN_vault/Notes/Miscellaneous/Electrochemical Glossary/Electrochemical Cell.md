> An electrochemical cell is a device capable of either generating electrical energy from chemical reactions or using electrical energy to cause chemical reactions. 

The electrochemical cells which generate an electric current are called voltaic or [[galvanic cells]] and those that generate chemical reactions, via electrolysis for example, are called [[electrolytic cells]].

The main components of an electrochemical cell are:

### Electrodes 
- The solid electrical conductor composed of good conductors such as metals in an electrochemical cell are known as electrodes. They are of two types:
  a) The Anode 
    - The cell compartment where oxidation takes place.
  b) The Cathode 
  - The cell compartment where reduction takes place.
### Electrolyte 
- An electrolyte is a compound contained in between the electrodes that produce freely moving ions resulting in an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in polar solvents, such as water. 

### Salt Bridge 
- This connects the oxidation half and reduction half of an electrochemical cell and completes the electrochemical circuit. It is filled with saturated salt solutions like KCl
K
C
l
. The bridge allows the ions in the solution to move from one half-cell to another, which is vital for the reaction to continue. A filter paper dipped in Potassium Nitrate or Sodium Chloride solution can act as an example of salt bridge.
