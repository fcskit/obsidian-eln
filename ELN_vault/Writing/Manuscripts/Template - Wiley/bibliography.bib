  abstract = {Histidine, inspired by vanadium bromoperoxidase enzyme, has been applied as a homogeneous electrocatalyst to the positive electrolyte of vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) to improve the performance and stability of VRFB at elevated temperatures. The histidine-containing electrolyte is found to significantly improve the performance of VRFB in terms of thermal stability estimated by the remaining amount of VO2+ in the electrolyte (61 vs 43\% of a pristine one), energy efficiency at a high current density of 150 mA cm-2 (78.7 vs 71.2\%), and capacity retention (73.2 vs 27.7\%) at 60 °C. The mechanism of the catalytic functions of histidine with the chemical species in the electrolyte has been investigated for the first time by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The analyzed data reveal that histidine improves the kinetics of both charge and discharge reactions through different affinity toward the reactants and products as well as suppresses the precipitation of VO2+ by impeding the polymerization of vanadium ions. These findings are in good agreement with the improved chemical and electrochemical performance of the histidine-containing VRFB. Our results show a new type of chemical/electrochemical mechanism in the improved redox flow battery performance that may be essential in a new research arena for better performance of electrochemical systems.},

However, at certain battery operating conditions, the SEI breakdown leading to more electrolyte decomposition reactions that form several species on the anode electrode surface. This paper focuses on the effect of battery potential and charge rate on the decomposition side reaction on the anode electrode of a lithium ion polymer battery, as a result of the breakdown of the SEI layer. The results from this study indicate that raising the state of charge (SOC) increases the rate of the electrolyte decomposition side reaction that resulted in formation of a thick deposit layer at the electrolyte/electrolyte interface. This deposit layer contains lithium that can no longer participate in the reversible electrochemical reaction. In addition, at high cycling potential and charge rates the amount of lithium in the graphite after complete cell discharge increased due to the entrapment of lithium in the graphite. The amount of irreversible capacity loss for the batteries cycled at high potential and current correlates with the amount of trapped lithium in the graphite and the growth of the deposit layer thickness at the electrode/electrolyte interface.},

  abstract = {The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer plays a critical role in the cycle life of Li-ion batteries. The potential difference across the SEI during charging results in the potential for Li+intercalation at the graphite-SEI interface to be lower than the potential at the SEI-electrolyte interface, which can prevent electrolyte reduction and decomposition. The stability of the SEI layer at certain critical battery operating conditions remains a challenge in the performance of lithium ion batteries. Electrolyte additives and surface modification of the anode electrode have been shown to improve the formation of an effective SEI layer. However, there is still a need for improving the robustness of the SEI to withstand extreme battery operating conditions. In this paper, the formation and stability of the SEI layer for lithium ion batteries is reviewed.

  abstract = {© 2017 The Electrochemical Society. The flow in a vanadium redox flow battery, which is determined by flow rate and geometry of flow channels, is an important factor in determining battery performance. Therefore, flow rate and flow channel must be carefully designed and controlled to provide smooth supplies of electrolyte to the areas where electrochemical reactions take place. Through a verified three-dimensional electrochemical steady-state model involving fluid motion, it is found that channel height is an important geometric parameter that determines battery performance. We investigate its impact on pressure drop and penetration of the electrolyte into the electrode, and then examine how it ultimately played a role in voltage response, energy efficiency, and battery efficiency. To identify the optimal channel shape, various operating parameters (including flow rate, current, and state of charge) are investigated at different channel heights. Overall, low-height cells are found to have better energy and battery efficiency, and can operate at relatively lower optimal flow rates. There is, however, a trade-off between an improved flow field and pumping loss, depending on geometry and loading conditions. A judicious balance between them would be useful in finding the optimal flow channel geometry and ideal loading conditions for the best performance of flow batteries.},

  abstract = {This review paper summarizes and critically discusses the morphology and structure formation of carbon fibers (CFs) from polymer precursor systems. Throughout this review, we focus on the key mutual interactions between the polymeric precursor systems, their physically determined processability into filaments, the thermally initiated crystal conversion mechanisms, as well as the morphological and physical properties of the resulting CFs and graphite fibers (GFs). Understanding the behavior of crystal conversion mechanisms from a polymeric semi-crystalline structure into a turbostratic, glass-like or even a graphite-like carbonaceous crystalline structure is essential to carbon and graphite fiber formation. The nature of the crystal conversion and thermal processing largely determine the recovery degree and behavior of the carbonaceous crystal orientation. Over the last three decades, CFs and GFs have earned a significant reputation as lightweight fibrous reinforcement materials, and considerable advances have been achieved in understanding the structure of CFs and GFs and in tailoring their performance towards specific applications. The utilization of CFs and GFs in different thermoplastics and thermosets, as well as in concrete as reinforcements, is well known thanks to the abundant number of reports and reviews available. Nevertheless, large-scale utilization of CFs in high-technology sectors, such as the aerospace industry, is mainly driven by the required performance of the CFs. For civilian applications such as general engineering and the automotive industry, however, the large-scale production of CFs is immensely limited by production costs. Numerous reports and reviews are available in the field of CFs and its precursors. Therefore, we focus on reviewing the less-discussed structure–property relationship and the influence of the different manufacturing processes on this relationship. Throughout this review, we identify areas that require future research and development regarding the morphology and structure formation of CFs from emerging precursor systems, e.g., lignin.},

  abstract = {The United States electricity grid is undergoing rapid changes in response to the sustained low price of natural gas, the falling cost of electricity from variable renewable resources (which are increasingly being paired with Li-ion storage with durations up to ∼4 h at rated power), and state and local decarbonization policies. Although the majority of recent electricity storage system installations have a duration at rated power of up to ∼4 h, several trends and potential applications are identified that require electricity storage with longer durations of 10 to ∼100 h. Such a duration range lies between daily needs that can be satisfied with technologies with the cost structure of lithium-ion batteries and seasonal storage utilizing chemical storage in underground reservoirs. The economics of long-duration storage applications are considered, including contributions for both energy time shift and capacity payments and are shown to differ from the cost structure of applications well served by lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the capital cost for the energy subsystem must be substantially reduced to ∼3 \$/kWh (for a duration of ∼100 h), ∼7 \$/kWh (for a duration of ∼50 h), or ∼40 \$/kWh (for a duration of ∼10 h) on a fully installed basis. Recent developments in major technology classes that may approach the targets of the long-duration electricity storage (LDES) cost framework, including electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical, are briefly reviewed. This perspective, which illustrates the importance of low-cost and high-energy-density storage media, motivates new concepts and approaches for how LDES systems could be economical and provide value to the electricity grid. The feasibility of incorporating a large share of power from variable energy resources such as wind and solar generators depends on the development of cost-effective and application-tailored technologies such as energy storage. Energy storage technologies with longer durations of 10 to 100 h could enable a grid with more renewable power, if the appropriate cost structure and performance—capital costs for power and energy, round-trip efficiency, self-discharge, etc.—can be realized. Although current technologies such as lithium-ion batteries are suitable for a number of applications on the grid, they are not suitable for longer-duration storage applications. Although 10 to 100 h energy storage will help facilitate the integration of renewable power on the grid, it is not long enough to last for seasons, and is not sufficient to enable a grid with 100\% renewable power. Given the capital-intensive nature of scaling up a storage technology that can be impactful to the overall electricity grid, rigorous technical and economic evaluations at the laboratory and pilot scale are required. Several major classes of storage technologies may address the long-duration electricity storage cost and performance framework, and efforts are accelerating to identify and develop the most promising storage systems. Long-duration electricity storage systems (10 to ∼100 h at rated power) may significantly advance the use of variable renewables (wind and solar) and provide resiliency to electricity supply interruptions, if storage assets that can be widely deployed and that have a much different cost structure (i.e., installed energy subsystem costs of ∼5 to 35 \$/kWh, installed power subsystem costs of ∼500 to 1,000 \$/kW, and a round-trip efficiency of {$>$}50\%) than Li-ion can be developed.},

  abstract = {Although many studies have demonstrated the excellent potential of hard carbon as an anode in sodium ion batteries, the contribution of its active sites to the capacities of the sloping and plateau voltage regions is not yet clear. Herein, systematical investigation of the relationship between the active sites and sodium ion (Na+) storage in the sloping and plateau voltage regions was presented. In light of the physicochemical properties of the lignin-derived hard carbon (graphitization degree, interlayer spacing, micropore size distribution, and specific surface area), the results of Na+ ion diffusivity, and the change in these properties during Na+ ion insertion/extraction (as characterized by ex situ techniques), new mechanistic insights into Na+ ion storage were proposed. At the beginning of the sodiation process, Na+ ions were adsorbed on defect/edge sites; then partial micropore filling occurred in the sloping region above 0.1 V. In the plateau region below 0.1 V, Na+ ions were intercalated in the graphitic layers, and further adsorption in the micropores occurred near the cutoff potential. Furthermore, sodium clustering occurred below 0.1 V owing to the high concentration of Na+ ions in the micropores. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Recent developments in 3D-printing of materials enable a transforming technology for fast, reproducible and documented cell manufacture. This technology can give an improved engineering approach to cell design and fabrication, needed to fulfil requirements for lower cost, longer lifetime hardware capable of efficient reliable performance. It can also be used to implement a flexible design methodology to suit various scales of operation, usually important during RFB development. In the case of electrolyte flow features, these needs are especially well met by fast prototyping strategies. This paper demonstrates the importance of 3D-printing for the realization of a hybrid zinc-cerium RFB laboratory cell. The design and fabrication process is described and the benefits offered by 3D-printing are considered. Finally, further opportunities offered by this approach to RFB manufacture and research are highlighted.},

  abstract = {The gas diffusion layer (GDL) in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is one of the functional components that provide a support structure for gas and water transport. The GDL plays a crucial role when the oxidant is air, especially when the fuel cell operates in the higher current density region. There has been an exponential growth in research and development because the PEMFC has the potential to become the future energy source for automotive applications. In order to serve in this capacity, the GDL requires due innovative analysis and characterization toward performance and durability. It is possible to achieve the optimum fuel cell performance only by understanding the characteristics of GDLs such as structure, pore size, porosity, gas permeability, wettability, thermal and electrical conductivities, surface morphology and water management. This review attempts to bring together the characterization techniques for the essential properties of the GDLs as handy tools for R\&D institutions. Topics are categorized based on the ex-situ and in-situ characterization techniques of GDLs along with related modeling and simulation. Recently reported techniques used for accelerated durability evaluation of the GDLs are also consolidated within the ex-situ and in-situ methods. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Biomass is a sustainable precursor of hard carbons destined for use in sodium-ion batteries. This study explores the synthesis of hard carbon nanosheets (HCNS) from oxidized cork and impact of synthesis temperature on the hard carbon characteristics. An increase in the carbonization temperature from 1000 to 1500 degrees C generally leads to lower BET specific surface areas (similar to 55 to 20 m(2) g(-1)) and d(002) interlayer spacing (similar to 4.0 to 3.7 angstrom). The effect of synthesis temperature is reflected in the initial coulombic efficiency (iCE) which increases from 72\% at 1000 degrees C to 88\% at 1500 degrees C, as a result of the decrease in surface area, and structural defects in the hard carbon as verified using Raman scattering. The impact of cycling temperature (similar to 25, 30 and 55 degrees C) on the rate capability and long-term cycling is investigated using high precision coulometry cycler. For a galvanostatic test at 20 mA g(-1) and similar to 25 degrees C, a reversible capacity of 276 mAh g(-1) is observed with an iCE of similar to 88\%. Increasing cycling temperature enhances the rate performance, but slightly lowers the iCE (similar to 86\% at 30 degrees C and similar to 81\% at 55 degrees C). At 20 mA g(-1), the reversible capacities obtained at 30 degrees C and 55 degrees C are on average similar to 260 and similar to 270 mAh g(-1), respectively. For constant-current constant-voltage (CCCV) tests conducted at 30 degrees C, reversible capacities ranging from 252 to 268, 247-252, and 237-242 mAh g(-1) can be obtained at 10, 100, and 1000 mA g(-1), respectively. The respective capacities obtained at 55 degrees C are about 272-290, 260-279, and 234-265 mAh g(-1) at 10, 100 and 1000 mA g(-1). The applicability of the HCNS electrodes is eventually evaluated in full-cells with Prussian white cathodes, for which a discharge capacity of 152 mAh g(-1) is obtained with an iCE of similar to 90\%.},

  abstract = {Our increasing dependence on lithium-ion batteries for energy storage calls for continual improvements in the performance of their positive electrodes, which have so far relied solely on cationic redox of transition-metal ions for driving the electrochemical reactions. Great hopes have recently been placed on the emergence of anionic redox - a transformational approach for designing positive electrodes as it leads to a near-doubling of capacity. But questions have been raised about the fundamental origins of anionic redox and whether its full potential can be realized in applications. In this Review, we discuss the underlying science that triggers a reversible and stable anionic redox activity. Furthermore, we highlight its practical limitations and outline possible approaches for improving such materials and designing new ones. We also summarize their chances for market implementation in the face of the competing nickel-based layered cathodes that are prevalent today.},

Covalent grafting of different organic moieties using diazonium chemistry is becoming a popular method for the modification of electrode materials. In this short review, basic information related to the synthesis of diazonium salt is given together with detailed mechanisms, characterization techniques and methods used for the chemical functionalization of the different electrode materials. Special emphasis is also given on the spontaneous covalent attachment of organic molecules by reduction of diazonium ions on surfaces as it provides a convenient way to scale-up for industrial productions. Moreover, recent advances on the use and contribution of the grafted molecules in enhancing the performance of electrochemical capacitor and lithium-ion batteries are presented.},

This work presents a multiplet-splitting approach comprising in minimum 3 third-row transition metals, namely, Mn, Co, and Ni, to improve the results in comparison to peak barycenter or single symmetric Voigt profile approaches. The achieved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 2p templates in particular address the complex peak structures consisting of significant photoelectron multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss features, and additional Auger and photoelectron overlaps, inevitable also for a reliable quantification. To separate from topography effects and contributions of the electrode's binder and conductive carbon in powder electrodes, the developed procedure in a first attempt was successfully transferred to novel radio frequency magnetron sputtered Li-Ni-Co-Mn-O thin films, designed for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. In all cases, special care was taken with respect to air sensitivity, contamination during sample handling, and probable method induced sample decomposition.},

Mixed transition-metal ferrites with the chemical formula MFe 2 O 4 (M=Co, Ni), synthesized through an inverse co-precipitation route, were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction, which demonstrate phase-pure compounds with particle sizes of about 100nm. Cyclic voltammetry investigations in lithium half-cells revealed a difference between the first cycle and the following charge-discharge cycles, which is characteristic for conversion-type electrode systems. To understand the mechanism of the electrochemical reaction in the first cycle, insitu X-ray absorption spectroscopy was performed during cycling at a charge-discharge rate of C/10. During the first discharge process, the crystalline Co and Ni ferrites undergo reduction. A coexistence of binary metal oxides (CoO/NiO and Fe 2 O 3 ) and metallic phases were observed during the discharge. At the end of discharge, only the existence of metallic nanoclusters was observed. In the subsequent charging process, Fe was found to undergo complete oxidation in both ferrites. In contrast, almost 60\% of the Co or Ni remained in the metallic state at the end of the charge (end of first cycle). This incomplete oxidation of Co and Ni in the applied voltage range could be the main reason behind the irreversible capacity loss and low coulombic efficiency often reported for these conversion electr ode systems.},

Here, we present an analytical framework (AF) to automatically identify the existing spectral signatures in the hyperspectral Raman dataset of LIB electrodes. The AF is entirely automated and requires fewer or almost no human assistance. The end-to-end pipeline of AF own the following features; (i) intelligently pre-processing the hyperspectral Raman dataset to eliminate the cosmic noise and baseline, (ii) extract all the reliable spectral signatures from the hyperspectral dataset and assign the class labels, (iii) training a neural network (NN) on to the precisely “labelled” spectral signature, and finally, examined the interoperability/reusability of already trained NN on to the newly measured dataset taken from the same LIB specimen or completely different LIB specimen for inline real-time analytics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to quantitatively assess the capacity degradation of LIB via a capacity retention coefficient that can be calculated by comparing the LMO signatures extracted by the analytical framework (AF). The present approach is suited for real-time vibrational spectroscopy based industrial applications; multicomponent chemical reactions, chromatographic, spectroscopic mixtures, and environmental monitoring.},

In this work, a commercially available carbon felt material, commonly used as electrodes in Vanadium Redox Flow Battery setups was evaluated for the transport properties (diffusivity, permeability, pressure drop required for maintaining flow, among others) while under seven set levels of compression, using an image analysis coupled with pore network modeling approach. X-ray computed tomography has been used to obtain the microstructure of a commercially available electrode under compressed conditions. An open-source pore network modeling tool, OpenPNM has been used to investigate the transport properties of the porous felt material at each of the set compression levels. The results from the modeling are compared against experimentally obtained electrolyte transport patterns visualized using synchrotron X-ray radiography. The electrical resistance of the carbon felt electrode was measured experimentally using a four-probe method. The compression resulted in a 58\% reduction in permeability, and a 25\% reduction in single-phase diffusion. This combination of ex-situ characterization of the electrical and fluid transport through the electrodes provides valuable data for modeling flow battery systems, and validating hypothesis from in situ testing.},

  abstract = {The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is one of the most mature and commercially available electrochemical technologies for large-scale energy storage applications. The VRFB has unique advantages, such as separation of power and energy capacity, long lifetime ({$>$}20 years), stable performance under deep discharge cycling, few safety issues and easy recyclability. Despite these benefits, practical VRFB operation suffers from electrolyte imbalance, which is primarily due to the transfer of water and vanadium ions through the ion-exchange membranes. This can cause a cumulative capacity loss if the electrolytes are not rebalanced. In commercial systems, periodic complete or partial remixing of electrolyte is performed using a by-pass line. However, frequent mixing impacts the usable energy and requires extra hardware. To address this problem, research has focused on developing new membranes with higher selectivity and minimal crossover. In contrast, this study presents two alternative concepts to minimize capacity fade that would be of great practical benefit and are easy to implement: (1) introducing a hydraulic shunt between the electrolyte tanks and (2) having stacks containing both anion and cation exchange membranes. It will be shown that the hydraulic shunt is effective in passively resolving the continuous capacity loss without detrimentally influencing the energy efficiency. Similarly, the combination of anion and cation exchange membranes reduced the net electrolyte flux, reducing capacity loss. Both approaches work efficiently and passively to reduce capacity fade during operation of a flow battery system.},

A segmented cell approach can be used to obtain in-situ information on flow behaviour, through the local voltage or current mapping. Lateral flow of current within the thick felts in the flow battery can hamper the interpretation of the data. In this study, a new method of segmenting a conventional flow cell is introduced, which for the first time, splits up both the porous felt as well as the current collector. This dual segmentation results in higher resolution and distinct separation of voltages between flow inlet to outlet. To study the flow behavior for an undivided felt, monitoring the OCV is found to be a reliable method, instead of voltage or current mapping during charging and discharging. Our approach to segmentation is simple and applicable to any size of the cell.},

  abstract = {Capacity loss due to electrolyte crossover through the membrane and pump losses due to pressure drop at the porous electrodes are widely known issues in vanadium redox flow batteries during operation. In commercial systems, these losses account for a significant reduction in the overall efficiency. Previous studies have been focused on the development of new membranes to solve the capacity loss, and design modification to reduce the pressure drop. In this work, we propose unique solutions to solve both problems and are demonstrated in a multi-cell stack for the first time. A 20-cell, 1 kW vanadium redox flow battery stack was assembled using thin bipolar plates and porous electrodes featuring interdigitated flow channels. Such a stack design is novel of its kind and can mitigate various problems associated with flow distribution and pump power in flow batteries. In addition, the electrolyte tanks were shunted together to rebalance the electrolyte automatically. The stack showed a very good and stable performance with an energy efficiency of 80.5\% at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. The use of hydraulic shunt resulted in a constant capacity over 250 cycles while the use of flow channels on the porous electrodes resulted in ∼40\% reduction in pressure drop, compared to a stack with standard felts. The reduction in pressure drop by employing flow channels reduced the pump power proportionally. Overall, capacity retention and utilization of active materials have been improved substantially. These methods are simple and applicable to any size of vanadium redox flow battery.},

  abstract = {The complexity of the electrochemical interface when modified by molecular adsorbates can be significant, especially those that are used for biosensing (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins). Characterizing these sensor surfaces typically involves using many in situ and ex situ methods. Studying the biomolecule-modified interface in aqueous buffer is necessary and can be facilitated through the use of fluorophore labeling and microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy has been developed for studying biological samples with constantly improving spatial and temporal resolutions. Adapting these methods for the study of electrochemical interfaces provides unique opportunities to study the structure and dynamic behavior of the adsorbed molecules. Outlined are important considerations for implementing fluorescence microscopy in electrochemical environments along with a brief review of various microscopy techniques and their use for in situ examination of the interface. Far-field and confocal imaging as well as single molecule localization microscopy are briefly described for study of adsorbed structures on the surface resulting in resolutions that span many orders of magnitude (mm to nm). Characterizing the local chemical environment of the adsorbed layers using Förster energy transfer and fluorescence lifetime imaging are discussed. These advanced approaches to imaging and characterizing electrochemical interfaces reveal more than the average behavior, providing the ability to question the influence of the variety of possible adsorbed structures on the performance of the interface.}

It was shown that, for all carbon materials investigated, the kinetics of VII-VIII is enhanced by anodic, and inhibited by cathodic, treatment of the electrode; in contrast, the kinetics of VIV-VV is inhibited by anodic, and enhanced by cathodic, treatment. The potential region for each of these effects varied only slightly with carbon material. Rate constants were always greater for VIV-VV than for VII-VIII except when anodized electrodes were compared, which may explain discrepancies in the literature. The observed effects are attributed to oxygen-containing functional-groups on the electrode surface. The considerable differences between the potentials at which enhancement of VII-VIII and inhibition of VIV-VV occur indicates that they do not correspond to a common oxidized state of the electrode. Likewise inhibition of VII-VIII and enhancement of VIV-VV do not correspond to a common reduced state of the electrode. It is possible that enhancement of both VII-VIII and VIV-VV is due to the same (active) state of the electrode.}

Contact resistance was seen to reduce from ca. 2.0 Ω cm 2 to 1.2 Ω cm 2 and an energy efficiency of 85\% was obtained from a felt compressed to 75\%. Moreover, X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been employed to study the microstructure of felt electrodes at compressions up to 70\%, showing a linear decrease in porosity and a constant fibre surface a rea-to-volume ratio. The pressure drop was modelled using computational fluid dynamics and employing the 3D structure of the felts obtained from CT, revealing that a 60\% increase in compression related to a 44.5\% increase in pressure drop.},

This work thus bridges a gap in the literature and shows not only that compressed sensing is viable in this context, but also that accurate recovery is possible via an ℓ1-analysis optimization problem. We introduce a condition on the measurement/sensing matrix, which is a natural generalization of the now well-known restricted isometry property, and which guarantees accurate recovery of signals that are nearly sparse in (possibly) highly overcomplete and coherent dictionaries. This condition imposes no incoherence restriction on the dictionary and our results may be the first of this kind. We discuss practical examples and the implications of our results on those applications, and complement our study by demonstrating the potential of ℓ1-analysis for such problems. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {ConspectusElectrochemical alloying reactions of group IV elements, such as Si, Ge, or Sn, with lithium provide a promising route to next-generation anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high volumetric and gravimetric capacities. However, commercialization of these anodes is still sparse owing to quick capacity fading and limited Coulombic efficiency, which arise from large volume expansion leading to particle cracking and subsequent electrochemical inactivity. As a result, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), originating in the decomposition of the electrolyte upon battery operation outside the electrolyte's thermodynamic stability window, grows uncontrollably. While a large number of mitigation strategies have been developed, an improved nanometer level fundamental understanding of the (de)lithiation process and SEI formation, growth, and evolution is necessary to overcome these challenges. Toward this end, many experimental and theoretical approaches have been utilized but still provide an incomplete picture. This is due to the difficulty of investigating buried interfaces and interphases of lithiation products and thin SEI layers (nanometer-scale) in situ and with the desired nanometer accuracy.In this Account, we illustrate the utilization of in situ X-ray reflectivity (XRR) to provide nanometer-scale insights on the SEI nucleation, growth, and evolution, and well as the (de)lithiation process of Si electrodes. XRR is a nondestructive and surface- and interface-sensitive technique that allows for in situ investigations during battery operation under realistic electrochemical conditions. Insight into the system is provided via the surface-normal density profile, which is interpreted in terms of thickness, density, and roughness of individual surface layers, allowing monitoring of the interfacial morphology and chemistry evolution, through which the SEI growth and Si (de)lithiation process can be resolved.We utilized a model battery anode consisting of a native oxide terminated single crystalline Si wafer in half cell configuration with standard electrolyte in a specifically designed in situ XRR electrochemical cell. We have resolved the nucleation and formation process of the inner inorganic SEI and have observed two well-defined inorganic SEI layers on Si anodes: a bottom-SEI layer (adjacent to the electrode) formed via the lithiation of the native oxide and a top-SEI layer mainly consisting of the electrolyte decomposition product, LiF. This SEI layer grows during lithiation and contracts during delithiation. Further, our results show that the lithiation of crystalline Si (c-Si) is a layer-by-layer, reaction-limited, two-phase process with a well-defined phase boundary between LixSi lithiation product and c-Si; in contrast, the delithiation of LixSi and the lithiation of amorphous Si (a-Si) are reaction-limited, single-phase processes. Moreover, we resolved the influences of current density and the Si crystallographic orientation of the reaction interface on the (de)lithiation process. The implications of our findings are discussed with regard to battery performance.},

The typical HT-PEMFC operating temperatures are in the range of 100-200 °C which allows for co-generation of heat and power, high tolerance to fuel impurities and simpler system design. This paper reviews the current literature concerning the HT-PEMFC, ranging from cell materials to stack and stack testing. Only acid doped PBI membranes meet the US DOE (Department of Energy) targets for high temperature membranes operating under no humidification on both anode and cathode sides (barring the durability). This eliminates the stringent requirement for humidity however, they have many potential drawbacks including increased degradation, leaching of acid and incompatibility with current state-of-the-art fuel cell materials. In this type of fuel cell, the choice of membrane material determines the other fuel cell component material composition, for example when using an acid doped system, the flow field plate material must be carefully selected to take into account the advanced degradation. Novel research is required in all aspects of the fuel cell components in order to ensure that they meet stringent durability requirements for mobile applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Coulter dispersants were investigated as the additive into the positive electrolyte (more than 1.8 M vanadium ions) of vanadium redox flow battery (VRB). The electrolyte stability tests showed that, at 45, 50 and 60 °C, the addition of 0.050-0.10 w/w Coulter dispersant IIIA (mainly containing coconut oil amine adduct with 15 ethylene oxide groups) into the positive electrolyte of VRB could significantly delay the time of precipitate formation from 1.8-12.3 h to 30.3 h ∼ 19.3 days. Moreover, the trace amount of Coulter dispersant IIIA as the additive can enhance the electrolyte stability without changing the valence state of vanadium ions, reducing the reversibility of the redox reactions and incurring other side reactions at the electrode. Using the Coulter IIIA dispersant as the additive also improved the energy efficiency of the VRB. The UV-vis spectra confirmed that the trace amount of Coulter IIIA dispersant did not chemically react with V(V) to form new substances. The synergy of Coulombic repulsion and steric hindrance between the macromolecular cationic surfactant additive and the solution reduced the aggregation of vanadium ions into V 2O 5 and increased the supersaturation of V 2O 5 crystal in the solution. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Despite the important role of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) binders in graphite electrodes for Li-ion batteries, the direct analysis of these binders remains challenging, particularly at very low concentrations as in practical graphite anodes. In this paper, we report the systematic investigation of the physiochemical behavior of the CMC and SBR binders and direct observations of their distributions in practical graphite electrodes. The key to this unprecedented capability is combining the advantages of several analytic techniques, including laser-ablation laser-induced break-down spectroscopy, time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and a surface and interfacial cutting analysis system. By correlating the vertical distribution with the adsorption behaviors of the CMC, our study reveals that the CMC migration toward the surface during the drying process depends on the degree of cross-linked binder-graphite network generation, which is determined by the surface property of graphite and CMC materials. The suggested analytical techniques enable the independent tracing of CMC and SBR, disclosing the different vertical distribution of SBR from that of the CMC binder in our practical graphite anodes. This achievement provides additional opportunity to analyze the correlation between the binder distribution and mechanical properties of the electrodes.},

  abstract = {Lignin as a by-product of fuel alcohol industry is used to prepare hard carbon materials by acetone extraction, stabilization in N-2 at 300 degrees C, carbonization in N2 and subsequent H-2 reduction at 800 degrees C. The effect of H2 reduction after carbonization process on the performances of the prepared samples is systematically studied and a simple mechanism is proposed. Excitingly, it is demonstrated that the process of H2 reduction has a favorable influence on both structures and electrochemical performances of pyrolysis sample and an obvious improvement of capacity performance is obtained with reduction treatment. A first discharge/charge capacity of 882.2/550.5 mA h g(-1) (coulombic efficiency (CE) of 62.4\%) is achieved at 0.1 C (1C = 372 mA g(-1)), and even after 200 cycles at 2 C a charge capacity of 228.8 mA h g(-1) (about 92.8\% retention ratio) remains and CE is above 99\% during cycles for H2 reduced sample. The fabulous electrochemical performance could be attributed to high purity of acetone-extracted lignin, low surface oxygen-containing functional groups and relatively high graphitization degree of reduction sample. In a word, both the simple pyrolysis process and excellent electrochemical performance make lignin-based hard carbon a promising anode material for high-capacity and high-stability lithium ion batteries (LIBs).

However, the uncertain sodium storage mechanism hinders the rational design and synthesis of high-performance hard carbon anode materials for practical SIBs. During the past decades, tremendous efforts have been put to stimulate the development of hard carbon materials. In this review, we discuss the recent progress of the study on the sodium storage mechanism of hard carbon anodes, and the effective strategies to improve their sodium storage performance have been summarized. It is anticipated that hard carbon anodes with high electrochemical properties will be inspired and fabricated for large-scale energy storage applications.},

The sulfur copolymer and the hybrids were thoroughly characterized in structure and chemical composition, and finally tested by electrochemical benchmarking. An enhancement of specific capacity was observed over 140 cycles at higher content of carbon onions in the hybrid electrodes. The copolymer hybrids demonstrate a maximum initial specific capacity of 1150 mA h gsulfur−1 (850 mA h gelectrode−1) and a low decay of capacity to reach 790 mA h gsulfur−1 (585 mA h gelectrode−1) after 140 charge/discharge cycles. All carbon onion/sulfur copolymer hybrid electrodes yielded high chemical stability, stable electrochemical performance superior to conventional melt-infiltrated reference samples having similar sulfur and carbon onion content.

  abstract = {Flow batteries have unique characteristics that make them especially attractive when compared with conventional batteries, such as their ability to decouple rated maximum power from rated energy capacity, as well as their greater design flexibility. The vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) seem to have several advantages among the existing types of flow batteries as they use the same material (in liquid form) in both half-cells, eliminating the risk of cross contamination and resulting in electrolytes with a potentially unlimited life. Given their low energy density (when compared with conventional batteries), VRFB are especially suited for large stationary energy storage, situations where volume and weight are not limiting factors. This includes applications such as electrical peak shaving, load levelling, UPS, and in conjunction with renewable energies (e.g. wind and solar). The present work thoroughly reviews the VRFB technology detailing their genesis, the basic operation of the various existing designs and the current and future prospects of their application. The main original contribution of the work was the addressing of a still missing in-depth review and comparison of existing, but dispersed, peer reviewed publications on this technology, with several original and insightful comparison tables, as well as an economic analysis of an application for storing excess energy of a wind farm and sell it during peak demand. The authors have also benefited from their background in electric mobility to carry out original and insightful discussions on the present and future prospects of flow batteries in mobile (e.g. vehicle) and stationary (e.g. fast charging stations) applications related to this field, including a case study. Vanadium redox flow batteries are currently not suitable for most mobile applications, but they are among the technologies which may enable, when mature, the mass adoption of intermittent renewable energy sources which still struggle with stability of supply and lack of flexibility issues.},

  abstract = {This study presents a technique to directly characterize the carbon and binder domain (CBD) in lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery electrodes in three dimensions and use it to determine the effective transport properties of a LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC) electrode. X-ray nanocomputed tomography (nano-CT) is used to image an electrode composed solely of carbon and binder, whereas focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy is used to analyze cross-sections of a NMC electrode to gain morphological information regarding the electrode and CBD porosity. Combining the information gathered from these techniques reduces the uncertainty inherent in segmenting the nano-CT CBD data set and enables effective diffusivity of its porous network to be determined. X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) is then used to collect a NMC data set that is subsequently segmented into three phases, comprised of active material, pore, and CBD. The effective diffusivity calculated for the nano-CT data set is incorporated for the CBD present in the micro-CT data set to estimate the ensemble tortuosity factor for the NMC electrode. The tortuosity factor greatly increases when compared to the same data set segmented without considering the CBD. The porous network of the NMC electrode is studied with a continuous pore size distribution approach that highlights median radii of 180 nm and 1 μm for the CBD and NMC pores, respectively, and with a pore throat size distribution calculation that highlights median equivalent radii of 350 and 700 nm.},

Whereas, carbonaceous materials characterized by smaller graphitic domains or a higher degree of amorphous carbon show an increase of oxygen functional groups upon chemical and electrochemical pre-treatments. In both cases, an increase of oxygen species content on the surface above 5\% causes a decrease of electrochemical performance for the redox battery determined by an increase of ohmic and charge transfer resistance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Recently, new methods have been developed for the utilization of elemental sulfur as a feedstock for novel polymeric materials. One promising method is the inverse vulcanization, which is used to prepare polymeric structures derived from sulfur and divinyl comonomers. However, the mechanical and electrical properties of the products are virtually unexplored. Hence, in the present study, we synthesized a 200 g scale of amorphous, hydrophobic as well as translucent, hyperbranched polymeric sulfur networks that provide a high thermal resistance (\&gt;220 °C). The polymeric material properties of these sulfur copolymers can be controlled significantly by varying the monomers as well as the feed content. The investigated comonomers are divinylbenzene (DVB) and 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene (DIB). Plastomers with low elastic content and high shape retention containing 12.5\%–30\% DVB as well as low viscose waxy plastomers with a high flow behavior containing a high DVB content of 30\%–35\% were obtained. Copolymers with 15\%–30\% DIB act, on the one hand, as thermoplastics and, on the other hand, as vitreous thermosets with a DIB of 30\%–35\%. Results of the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) and mechanical characterization, such as stress–strain experiments and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, are discussed with the outcome that they support the assumption of a polymeric cross-linked network structure in the form of hyper-branched polymers.},

  abstract = {Oxygen plasma treatment was applied on commercially available graphite felt electrodes based on rayon (GFA) and polyacrylonitrile (GFD). The formation of functional groups on the surface of the felt was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The BET studies of the plasma treated electrodes showed no significant increase in surface area for both the rayon as well as the PAN based felts. Both plasma treated electrodes showed significantly enhanced V 3+ /V 2+ redox activity compared to the pristine electrodes. Since an increase of the surface area has been ruled out for plasma treated electrode the enhanced activity could be attributed to surface functional groups. Interestingly, plasma treated GFD felts showed less electrochemical activity towards V 5+/ V 4+ compared to the pristine electrode. Nevertheless, an overall increase of the single cell performance was still observed as the negative electrode is known to be the performance limiting electrode. Thus, to a great extent the present work helps to preferentially understand the importance of functional groups on the electrochemical activity of negative and positive redox reaction. The study emphasizes the need of highly active electrodes especially at the negative electrode side as inactive electrodes can still facilitate hydrogen evolution and degrade the electrolyte in VRFBs.},

  abstract = {Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon felt was subjected to N2-plasma treatment to increase the heteroatom defects and reactive edge sites as a method to increase the performance in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). N-doping in the felt was mainly in the form of pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen. Even though the amount of oxygen functional groups on the N2-plasma-treated sample was very low, the felt showed enhanced electrochemical performance for both V3+/V2+ as well as V5+/V4+ redox reactions. The result is highly significant as the pristine electrode with the same amount of oxygen functional groups showed significantly less activity for the V3+/V2+ redox reaction. Overall, the single-flow cell experiments with N2-plasma-treated felt showed superior performance compared to the pristine sample. Therefore, the enhanced performance observed for the N2-plasma-treated sample should be attributed to the increase in defects and edge sites. Thus, from the present study, it can be concluded that an alternate way to increase the performance of the VRFBs is to introduce specific defects such as N-doping/substitution or to increase the edge sites. In other words, defects induced in the carbon felt such as heteroatom doping are as beneficial as the presence of oxygen functional groups for the improved performance of VRFBs. Therefore, for an optimum performance of VRFBs, defects such as N-substitution as well as oxygen functionality should be tuned.},

The Rietveld refinement technique was successfully applied for structural characterization of the cell materials as function of fatigue introduced. The capacity loss determined from the electrochemical investigation has been found proportional to the number of cycles, which the cell underwent, and was 21.9\% and 12.8\% for the cell cycled for 1000 times at 25°C and 50°C, respectively. This capacity fade has a close correlation to the structural changes in cathode and anode materials with the cell fatigue.Achange of the lithium occupation and lattice parameters of the LixCoO 2 were observed with proceeding battery fatigue. Transformation of the graphitic anode into LiC6 and LiC 12 was identified after the batteries were fully charged. Their weight ratio was found to be dependent on the number of executed cycles. It was concluded that loss of the active lithium in both cathode and anode as well as microstructure changes on the anode side are important factors for the battery degradation. A favorable influence of the elevated cycling temperature on the battery performance was observed. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society.}

In particular, we aim for the sparsest representation possible. In general, this requires a combinatorial optimization process. Previous work considered the special case where D is an overcomplete system consisting of exactly two orthobases and has shown that, under a condition of mutual incoherence of the two bases, and assuming that S has a sufficiently sparse representation, this representation is unique and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem: specifically, minimizing the ℓ1 norm of the coefficients γ.

  abstract = {Hard carbons are extensively studied for application as anode materials in sodium-ion batteries, but only recently a great interest has been focused toward the understanding of the sodium storage mechanism and the comprehension of the structure–function correlation. Although several interesting mechanisms have been proposed, a general mechanism explaining the observed electrochemical processes is still missing, which is essentially originating from the remaining uncertainty on the complex hard carbons structure. The achievement of an in-depth understanding of the processes occurring upon sodiation, however, is of great importance for a rational design of optimized anode materials. In this review, we aim at providing a comprehensive overview of the up-to-date known structural models of hard carbons and their correlation with the proposed models for the sodium-ion storage mechanisms. In this regard, a particular focus is set on the most powerful analytical tools to study the structure of hard carbons (upon de-/sodiation) and a critical discussion on how to interpret and perform such analysis. Targeting the eventual commercialization of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries – after having established a fundamental understanding – we close this review with a careful evaluation of potential strategies to ensure a high degree of sustainability, since this is undoubtedly a crucial parameter to take into account for the future large-scale production of hard carbons.},

  abstract = {Hard carbons are currently the most widely used negative electrode materials in Na-ion batteries. This is due to their promising electrochemical performance with capacities of 200300 mAhg(-1) and stable long-term cycling. However, an abundant and cheap carbon source is necessary in order to comply with the low-cost philosophy of Na-ion technology. Many biological or waste materials have been used to synthesize hard carbons but the impact of the precursors on the final properties of the anode material is not fully understood. In this study the impact of the biomass source on the structural and electrochemical properties of hard carbons is unraveled by using different, representative types of biomass as examples. The systematic structural and electrochemical investigation of hard carbons derived from different sources-namely corncobs, peanut shells, and waste apples, which are representative of hemicellulose-, lignin- and pectin-rich biomass, respectively-enables understanding and interlinking of the structural and electrochemical properties.},

  abstract = {Lignin-derived hard carbon (HC) has great potential as energy storage materials. However, it is difficult to obtain desired electrochemical performances by direct carbonization of lignin. Herein, we demonstrate a pre-oxidation strategy to enhance the reversible capacity of hard carbon with lignin as precursor. The pre-oxidation mechanism and its influence on the microstructures of the resulted hard carbon are systematically studied. Based on in-situ FT-IR and C-13 NMR spectrum, etc., it is confirmed that three dominant configurations of oxygen-containing functional groups are formed during the process, and the content of the desired carbonyl groups (C=O) reaches a maximum value at a pre-oxidation temperature of 200 degrees C. Meanwhile, the alkyl groups are transformed into peroxides or alcohols, contributing to intermolecular cross-linkage within lignin. As a result, the obtained material with highly random orientation nanotexture gives a much larger d(002) and abundant porous structure. Benefiting from these structural merits, the optimized lignin-derived hard carbon enables excellent Li-ion storage performance with a reversible capacity of 584 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1).

Natural raw-materials such as biomass-biopolymer derived hierarchical nanostructured carbons are especially attractive for their uniform pore dimensions which can be adjustable over a wide range of length scales. Good electrical conductivity, high surface area, and excellent chemical stability are unique physicochemical properties which are responsible for micro/nanostructured porous carbon to be highly trusted candidate for emerging nanotechnologies. This review focuses on the 'out-of-the-box' synthetic techniques capable of deriving HPC with superior application profiles. The article presents the promising scope of accessing HPCs from (1) hard-templating, soft-templating, and non-templating routes, (2) biopolymers with a major focus on non-templating strategies. Subsequently, emerging strategies of hetero-atom doping in porous carbon nanostructures are discussed. The review will highlight the contribution of synergistic effect of macro-meso-micropores on a range of emerging applications such as CO2 capture, carbon photonic crystal sensors, Li-S batteries, and supercapacitor. Mechanism of ion transport and buffering, electrical double layer enhancement have been discussed in the context of pore structure and shapes. We will also show the differences of HPC and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) in terms of their synthesis strategies and choices of template for self-assembly. How the remarkable mechanical strength of the HPCs can be achieved by selecting self-assembling template, whereas collapse of mesostructure via decomposition of framework occurs due to poor thermal stability or high N-content of the carbon source will be discussed.},

We compared both the influence of the pre-treatment (carbonization or graphitization) and the influence of the precursor (Rayon or PAN). By thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) we showed, that after thermal treatment, the thermal stability was lower for carbonized felts compared to graphitized felts and the Rayon based felts were more stable than PAN based ones. Soaking had a stronger impact on the thermal stability of PAN based felts, whereas it was similar to the electrochemical ageing for Rayon based felts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that thermal treatment reduces the overall surface oxygen content for all felt types and the degree of graphitization doesn’t change, but the content of single bonded oxygen was increased for graphitized carbon felts, only. For carbonized felts, thermal treatment highly reduced the electrochemical activity characterized by cyclic voltammetry due to a reduced overall oxygen content and increased C=O and C=C contents. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of commercially available carbon felts and characterize the effects of several treatment methods.},

As a first step, the attenuation coefficient of NMC- and LFP-based coating is experimentally determined according to the Beer-Lambert law. Then, the attenuation coefficient of each active material is estimated from these experimental results and X-ray attenuation databases, which allows establishing an attenuation law for any coating composition. Finally, thanks to this relationship, the thickness can be evaluated in each spot of the film and the defects, such as pinholes or broad edges with gradual decrease of the thickness coating, can be detected. The analysis of NMC-, LFP- and NMC/LFP-based electrodes shows that the coating quality decreases as coating thickness increases and as the nanometric vs. micrometric material content increases in the coating composition. This reveals detrimental aspects of nanomaterials with respect to their use in composite electrode manufactured through conventional slot-die or casting process.},

  abstract = {Summary. Variable selection plays an important role in high dimensional statistical modelling which nowadays appears in many areas and is key to various scientific discoveries. For problems of large scale or dimensionality p, accuracy of estimation and computational cost are two top concerns. Recently, Candes and Tao have proposed the Dantzig selector using L1- regularization and showed that it achieves the ideal risk up to a logarithmic factor log (p). Their innovative procedure and remarkable result are challenged when the dimensionality is ultrahigh as the factor log (p) can be large and their uniform uncertainty principle can fail. Motivated by these concerns, we introduce the concept of sure screening and propose a sure screening method that is based on correlation learning, called sure independence screening, to reduce dimensionality from high to a moderate scale that is below the sample size. In a fairly general asymptotic framework, correlation learning is shown to have the sure screening property for even exponentially growing dimensionality. As a methodological extension, iterative sure independence screening is also proposed to enhance its finite sample performance. With dimension reduced accurately from high to below sample size, variable selection can be improved on both speed and accuracy, and can then be accomplished by a well-developed method such as smoothly clipped absolute deviation, the Dantzig selector, lasso or adaptive lasso. The connections between these penalized least squares methods are also elucidated. © 2008 Royal Statistical Society.},

  abstract = {Variable selection in high-dimensional space characterizes many contemporary problems in scientific discovery and decision making. Many frequently-used techniques are based on independence screening; examples include correlation ranking (Fan \& Lv, 2008) or feature selection using a twosample t-test in high-dimensional classification (Tibshirani et al., 2003). Within the context of the linear model, Fan \& Lv (2008) showed that this simple correlation ranking possesses a sure independence screening property under certain conditions and that its revision, called iteratively sure independent screening (ISIS), is needed when the features are marginally unrelated but jointly related to the response variable. In this paper, we extend ISIS, without explicit definition of residuals, to a general pseudo-likelihood framework, which includes generalized linear models as a special case. Even in the least-squares setting, the new method improves ISIS by allowing feature deletion in the iterative process. Our technique allows us to select important features in high-dimensional classification where the popularly used two-sample Mnethod fails. A new technique is introduced to reduce the false selection rate in the feature screening stage. Several simulated and two real data examples are presented to illustrate the methodology. ©2009 Jianqing Fan, Richard Samworth and Yichao Wu.},

This combined operando and multi-scale X-ray computed tomography (CT) technique is demonstrated as a comprehensive approach to understanding battery degradation and failure.},

  abstract = {Vanadium flow batteries are a promising system for stationary energy storage. One of their shortcomings is a low power density caused by slow kinetics of the redox reactions. To alleviate this drawback, many studies tried to catalyze the redox reactions. However, up to now, there is no consensus in the literature on which of the two half-cell reactions, the V2+/V3+ or the VO2+/VO2+reaction, features the slower electron transfer. The present study is the first showing that reaction rates for the half-cells are of the same order of magnitude with their respective rate constants depending on the composition of the electrode material. The surface functional groups hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl on carbon increase the wetted surface area, catalyze the V2+/V3+ redox reaction, but impede the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. This complex situation was unraveled by using a newly developed procedure based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Reaction mechanisms based on these results are discussed.},

  abstract = {The drying process is a crucial step in electrode manufacture that may lead to spatial inhomogeneities in the distribution of the electrode components resulting in impaired cell performance. Binder migration during the drying process, and the ensuing poor binder coverage in certain regions of the electrode, can lead to capacity fade and mechanical failure (e.g. electrode delamination from the current collector). A mathematical model of electrode drying is presented which tracks the evolution of the binder distribution, and is applicable in the relatively high drying rates encountered in industrial electrode manufacture. The model predicts that constant low drying rates lead to a favourable homogeneous binder profiles, whereas constant high drying rates are unfavourable and result in accumulation of binder near the evaporation surface and depletion near the current collector. These results show strong qualitative agreement with experimental observations and provide a cogent explanation for why fast drying conditions result in poorly performing electrodes. Finally, a scheme is detailed for optimisation of a time-varying drying procedure that allows for short drying times whilst simultaneously ensuring a close to homogeneous binder distribution throughout the electrode.},

However, despite its importance for the upcoming industrialization of PFSI-based products no detailed investigation of the welding behavior of PFSIs has been performed. This paper investigates the welding behavior of Nafion ® NRE-211 membranes common in both academia and industry over an industrially relevant parameter range of time, temperature and pressure. The strength evolution of the welded interface shows a linear dependence with square root of time and an Arrhenius temperature dependence. It is thus suggested that the welding behavior of Nafion ® membranes can be predicted by the reptation model from polymer dynamics. Time-temperature master curves for a large range of parameters are constructed. Pressure is shown to have positive effects at very low welding times, but strongly negative effects at longer welding times, which can be explained by the model. Welding time and final strength of the fully healed interface are predicted usin g measurement and literature data. A short discussion on thermal transitions and on the role of crystallinity is also presented.},

  abstract = {Grid-scale energy storage systems are of interest as the world increases reliance on renewable energy sources. Redox flow batteries are a type of grid-scale energy storage technology that shows exceptional promise for accommodating the dynamic output of wind and solar power sources. The research community employs dozens of diagnostic techniques to investigate nearly all facets of these devices. Material properties, operational losses, transport, and integrated system properties are studied through the lens of electrochemical, physical, and chemical phenomena that ultimately dictate cost by influencing efficiency, durability, power, and capacity. These diagnostic techniques can, if applied correctly, elucidate not only the types of losses in redox flow batteries, but also tie those losses to fundamental driving forces in such systems so that next generation systems and models can be designed. This review details various diagnostic techniques used in flow battery analysis. The benefits, unique insights, and limitations of these techniques are discussed. Recommendations are also made to assist researchers in identifying the diagnostics that can advance their particular investigations. The review concludes with a summary of opportunities for new diagnostics that are needed to enable solution of persistent issues in redox flow battery research and development. The successful implementation of renewable energy sources to the electric grid requires robust energy storage systems. Grid scale en-ergy storage systems are being developed at a higher rate than ever before and are available in multiple technological formats. There, is of yet, no superior energy storage option for all types of ap-plications since technologies vary in terms of performance charac-teristics, capital requirements, maturity level, lifetime, safety, relia-bility and the level of environmental and human risks. A compre-hensive analysis of different storage technologies is available in a recent report from Sandia National Laboratory. 1 There are several electrochemical-energy-based storage technologies including redox flow batteries (RFBs), non-flowing secondary batteries, regenerative fuel cells (RFCs), rechargeable metal-air batteries, supercapacitors and many others. Several review papers have discussed these tech-nologies in greater detail (e.g.). 2–5}

  abstract = {The influences of temperature on the formation losses and subsequent electrical performance of Li x (Ni 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 ) y O 2 (NCM)/graphite lithium-ion cells were investigated. It was shown that the total capacity loss during formation of a full cell at 25 °C consists of losses on the positive and negative electrode to about one half each. The losses of the negative electrode (ca. 10\%) are due to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on graphite but are masked by the losses of the positive side (ca. 20\%) which are mainly caused by a kinetic inhibition of NCM and are theoretically reversible when the cell is discharged to very low potentials. The total loss of a full cell fits with the loss of the positive electrode. With increased temperature the ratio of losses on positive and negative electrode decreases as the diffusion coefficient of lithium in NCM increases. In total, an elevated formation temperature leads to increased irreversible losses on both electrodes and significantly lower cell performance of graphite. The upper cut-off voltage has an influence on the positive electrode formation losses in a reversible manner. The constituents of the SEI identified via the combination of XPS and FTIR are mainly RCH 2 OCO 2 Li, RCOOLi and LiF for the outer SEI and mainly Li 2 CO 3, Li 2 O and LiF for the inner SEI. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Its commercialization for high-value added products remains largely unexplored today. Herein, we explored the preparation of hard carbon anodes for sodium-ion batteries using the two most common lignin grades, i.e, lignin kraft and lignin sulphonate. The lignin kraft hard carbon (LK-HC) shows small specific surface area (1.8 m(2)g(-1)) and a dense random like morphology while the latter lignin sulphonate hard carbon (LS-HC) presents a high surface area (180 m(2)g(-1)) and spherical particles containing macropores. Their electrochemical performances vs. Na+ revealed a steady capacity of 181 mAh g(-1) over cycling for LK-HC, as compared to a capacity of 205 mAh g(-1) for LS-HC which fades after 30 cycles due to an impurity-driven growth of a blocking solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). To circumvent this issue, an efficient washing procedure was successfully implemented enabling to obtain (LSW-HC) carbons which deliver a high and stable capacity (284 mAh g(-1)) along efficiency (78.1\%).

In the conventional cell design, flat sheets of graphite bipolar plates and porous graphite felts are stacked without any bonding, which requires a certain degree of compression to minimize the contact resistance. Excessive compression of the electrode, however, leads to non-uniform flow distribution and potential occurrence of zones with the retarded flow of electrolyte. This study investigates a wide range of electrode compressions and their effect on the cell performance. The results show that a compression of 25\% is the optimal trade-off between contact resistance, homogeneity of flow distribution and pumping losses. Moreover, spatially resolved measurements using a segmented cell are employed to visualize the flow distribution across the electrode in real time. The open circuit voltage after the termination of the cell charge/discharge is converted to the corresponding state of charge (SOC) of the electrolyte, and the difference between the theoretical and experimental state of charge of electrolyte is used to quantify the flow distribution across the electrode. The results show that the optimum conversion of the reactant can be achieved during a single pass at 25\% electrode compression. This method of segmentation is simple and scalable to any size of the battery.},

  abstract = {A sulfur-rich copolymer, poly(S-r-C-a) has been synthesized via a sustainable route, showing the utility of two major industrial wastes- elemental sulfur (petroleum waste) and cardanol (agro waste), to explore its potential as cathode material for Li-S batteries. The sulfur-rich copolymer exhibited a reduction in the active material dissolution into the electrolyte and a low self-discharge rate behavior during the rest time compared to an elemental sulfur cathode, indicating the chemical confinement of sulfur units. The presence of organosulfur moieties in copolymer suppress the irreversible deposition of end-discharge products on electrode surfaces and thus improve the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. This sulfur copolymer offered a reversible capacity of 892 mA h g−1 at 2nd cycle and maintained the capacity of 528 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 200 mA g−1. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) prepared via a sustainable route was used as a conductive filler to extract the better electrochemical performances from this sulfur copolymer. Such sustainable origin batteries prepared via economically viable showed an improved specific capacity of \textasciitilde 975 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 current rate with capacity fading of 0.15\% per cycle and maintained a stable performance over 500 cycles at 2000 mA g−1.},

  note = {Der Energiebedarf aktueller Technologien, wie etwa von Smartphones, Drohnen und Elektrofahrzeugen, zwingt die Hersteller von Lithium-Ionen-Zellen dazu, die Energiedichte ihrer Zellen immer weiter zu erhöhen. Als Folge davon werden vorhandene Sicherheitsmargen nahezu vollständig erschöpft und die Zellen arbeiten nahe an ihren Stabilitätsgrenzen. In dieser Konfiguration haben kleine Inhomogenitäten und Defekte, die während des Produktionsprozesses eingeprägt werden, einen starken Einfluss auf die Leistungsfähigkeit und Lebensdauer der Zelle. Folglich können unter anspruchsvollen Bedingungen Sicherheitsrisiken entstehen. Die Herstellung von Lithium-Ionen-Zellen, insbesondere von Elektroden, ist ein komplexer und unerbittlicher Prozess. Er erfordert eine kontinuierliche Überwachung einzelner Prozessparameter sowie der Produktqualität. Vor allem die kontinuierliche Erkennung und Klassifizierung von Adhäsionsverlusten an der Grenzfläche zwischen Beschichtung und Folie ist eine unzureichend analysierte Forschungsfrage und stellt die Zellhersteller vor enorme Herausforderungen. In dieser Dissertation wird eine neuartige, zerstörungsfreie ultraschallbasierte Prüfmethode entwickelt, die auf Lamb-Wellen und horizontal polarisierten Scherwellen basiert und in der Lage ist Adhäsionsverluste an der Grenzfläche zu detektieren. In der vorgeschlagenen Methodik werden die Metallfolien, welche als Substrate in Lithium-Ionen-Batterie-Elektroden dienen, als Wellenleiter und als Sensoren für das Ultraschallmesssignal verwendet. Zunächst wird die Theorie der Lamb-Wellen und der horizontal polarisierten Scherwellen für sowohl einschichtige als auch mehrschichtige Strukturen diskutiert und erweitert. Insbesondere die Anregung und der Empfang geführter akustischer Wellen werden theoretisch und experimentell untersucht. Das Vorhandensein von Inhomogenitäten, wie z.B. Fehlstellen in der Folie, Adhäsionsfehler an der Grenzfläche zwischen Beschichtung und Folie und Lücken im Beschichtungsmaterial, verändert die physikalischen Randbedingungen und beeinflusst die Ausbreitungsparameter der geführten Welle. Die Korrelation zwischen Fehlertypen und Veränderungen in der Amplitude, Frequenz, Energie und Ausbreitungsgeschwindigkeit des empfangenen Signals wird experimentell untersucht und später zur Fehleridentifikation und -klassifizierung genutzt. Die Anregung und der Empfang beider geführter Wellentypen erfolgt mit optimierten Ultraschall-Keilschallwandlern, die auf den beiden unbeschichteten Seitenflächen der Folie positioniert werden. Zudem wurde eine mechanische Konstruktion entwickelt und gefertigt, die bei niedrigem Anpressdrücken einen ausreichenden Schallkontakt sicherstellt, was wiederum ein ungestörtes Gleiten der Folie unter den Sensoren gewährleistet.Die Mehrfrequenzanregung in PZT-Keilwandlern durch die Ausnutzung von Dicken- und Planarschwingungen wird ebenfalls analysiert. Die Fehleridentifikation in blanken Metallfolien erfolgt mit den hochfrequenten Schwingungsanteilen. Dadurch lässt sich die hohe räumliche Empfindlichkeit von kleinen Wellenlängen ausnutzen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass auch 2 mm lange Kratzer und Risse mit diesem Ansatz durch die Analyse der Signalamplitude detektiert werden können. Durch das Beschichtungsmaterial werden die Sensorsignale in der Regel stark gedämpft und verzerrt. Daher lässt sich nur mit dem niederfrequenten Anteil der PZT-Schwingung ein Messsignal mit der notwendigen Amplitude in beschichteten Elektroden anregen und empfangen. Die experimentellen Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Signaländerungen von der Absorptionsrate des Beschichtungsmaterials abhängen. Bei Beschichtungen mit geringerer Dämpfung nimmt das empfangene Signal ab, und bei Beschichtungen mit höherer Dämpfung nimmt das empfangene Signal bei Vorhandensein von Fehlern zu. Die experimentellen Untersuchungen zeigen, dass für die Detektion und Klassifizierung von Adhäsionsdefekten und Beschichtungslücken in Elektroden die Steigung und der Endwert des Integrals der quadratischen Signalamplitude als Messgrößen bevorzugt geeignet ist. Insgesamt konnte der Proof-of-Concept für das entwickelte Diagnose-System erfolgreich erbracht werden The energy requirements of current technologies, such as smartphones, drones, and electric vehicles, have forced lithium-ion cell manufactures to relentlessly increase the energy density of their cells. As a consequence, safety margins have been exhausted and cells operate near the edge of stability. In this configuration, minor inhomogeneities and flaws induced during the production process strongly affect cell performance and durability. Consequently, safety risks can emerge under demanding circumstances. The production of lithium-ion cells, especially of electrodes thereof, is a complex process. It requires continuous monitoring of process parameters and of output quality. Particularly, the detection and classification of adhesion losses at the coating-foil interface suffer under inefficient and high-cost monitoring systems. In this dissertation, a novel non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method is developed based on ultrasonic Lamb waves and horizontally polarized shear waves to overcome this shortcoming. In the proposed methodology, metal foils serving as substrates in lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrodes are used as wave guides for measuring ultrasonic signals. The theory of Lamb waves and horizontally polarized shear waves is discussed and extended for singe-layered and multi-layered structures. In particular, the excitation and reception of acoustic guided waves (AGW) are investigated theoretically and experimentally. The presence of inhomogeneities, such as flaws in the foil, adhesion flaws at the coating-foil interface, and gaps in the coating material, changes boundary conditions and influences guided wave propagation parameters. The correlation between flaw types and changes in the received signal amplitude, frequency, energy, and propagation velocity is investigated experimentally and later utilized for flaw identification and classification. The excitation and reception of both guided wave types are performed with optimized ultrasonic wedge transducers, which are positioned on both uncoated side areas of the foil. A mechanical construction was developed and manufactured to ensure valid acoustic contact at low contact pressure conditions, which in turn guarantees an undisturbed sliding of the foil under the sensors. The utilization of little or no couplant media also prevents any coating corruption.Advantages of multi-frequency wave excitation through the utilization of thickness and planar oscillation in piezoelectric ceramic PZT wedge transducers are discussed as well as theoretically and experimentally investigated. Flaw identification in blank foils is performed with the high frequency component of the PZT transducer oscillations. In this way, the high spatial sensitivity of short wavelengths can be exploited. The results prove that even 2 mm long scratches and cracks can be detected with this approach by analyzing the signal’s peak amplitude. In general, the sensing signals are highly damped and distorted by the coating material. Therefore, the low frequency component of the PZT transducer oscillations must be used to excite and to receive appropriate sensing amplitudes. The experimental findings show that signal changes depend on the coating material absorption rate. In coatings with lower attenuation, the received signal decreases, and in those with higher attenuation, the received signal increases in the presence of flaws. The slope and end-value of square signal integrals are identified as the preferred measurands for adhesion and gap flaw detection and classification in electrodes. Overall, the proof of concept for the proposed guided-wave-based monitoring system was successfully provided, and this supports the suitableness of the developed methodology as well as the mechanical setup

Many studies have focused on the cathode materials to improve the cell performance. In this work we present a series of poly (S-DVB) copolymers synthesised by inverse vulcanization of sulfur with divinylbenzene (DVB). The poly (S-DVB) cathode shows excellent cycling performances at C/2 and C/4 current rates, respectively. It was demonstrated poly (S-DVB) copolymer containing 20\% DVB did not influence the electrochemical performance of the sulfur material, compared to elemental sulfur as high specific capacities over ∼700 mAh g−1 at 500 cycles were achieved at C/4 current rate, comparable to conventional carbon-based S cathodes. However, the use of copolymer network is assumed to act firstly as sulfur reservoir and secondly as mechanical stabilizer, enhancing significantly the cycling lifetime. The Li-poly (S-DVB) cell demonstrated an extremely low degradation rate of 0.04\% per cycle achieving over 1600 cycles at C/2 current rate.}

  abstract = {Lithium–sulfur batteries are among the most promising next‐generation battery systems due to the high capacity of sulfur as cathodic material. Beyond its interesting intrinsic properties, sulfur possesses a very low conductivity and complex electrochemistry, which involves the high solubility of the lithium sulfides in the electrolyte. These two characteristics are at the core of a series of limitations of its performance as active cathode material, which leads to batteries with low cyclability. Recently, inverse vulcanized sulfur was shown to retain capacity far better than elemental sulfur, leading to batteries with excellent cyclability. Nevertheless, the diene co‐monomers used so far in the inverse vulcanization process are man‐made molecules. Herein, a tentative work on exploring inverse vulcanization using two naturally available monomers, diallyl sulfide and myrcene, is presented. The inverse vulcanization of sulfur was successfully completed, and the resulting polymers were characterized by FTIR, NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. Afterwards these polymers were tested as cathodic materials in lithium–sulfur cells. The sulfur–natural dienes materials exhibited high capacity at different C rates and high lifetime over 200 cycles with very high capacity retention at a moderate C rate of C/5. Altogether, these materials made from inexpensive and abundant chemicals are an excellent option as sustainable materials for electrochemical energy storage.},

In this study, succinic anhydride group, methoxyethanol, and methoxypolyethylene glycol segments are chemically bonded to the surfaces of graphite particles by the Diels-Alder and the subsequent esterification reactions. The synthesized functionalized graphites are excellent in water dispersibility. The electrochemical results indicate that the functionalization slightly reduces the initial coulombic efficiencies of the graphite anodes, but significantly changes the cycling stability and high C-rate performance of the corresponding lithium-ion cells. In particular, the cell based on the graphite functionalized by long-chain polyethylene glycol exhibits an improvement of 24.1 \% in cycle life compared with the pristine graphite. Further analysis shows that these trace organic groups change the properties of the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer depositing on the graphite surfaces, and therefore influence the performance of the cells.},

The lifetime of these batteries is limited by quinone stability. Here, we confirm that 2,6-dihydroxyanthrahydroquinone tends to form an anthrone intermediate that is vulnerable to subsequent irreversible dimerization. We demonstrate quantitatively that this decomposition pathway is responsible for the loss of battery capacity. Computational studies indicate that the driving force for anthrone formation is greater for anthraquinones with lower reduction potentials. We show that the decomposition can be substantially mitigated. We demonstrate that conditions minimizing anthrone formation and avoiding anthrone dimerization slow the capacity loss rate by over an order of magnitude. We anticipate that this mitigation strategy readily extends to other anthraquinone-based flow batteries and is thus an important step toward realizing renewable electricity storage through long-lived organic flow batteries.},

  abstract = {A novel bipolar graphite felt electrode for use in redox flow batteries and other electrochemical systems is described. The new electrode features a unique approach in the design of bipolar electrodes, employing carbon black free, nonconductive polymer materials as substrates. This innovation allows a dramatic reduction of processing time and cost compared to conventional carbon polymer composite electrodes used in bipolar battery systems. The conductivity of the new electrode assembly is similar to that of conventional bipolar electrodes, however, it shows significant improvements in mechanical properties. The functionality of these novel electrodes has been evaluated in the vanadium redox battery application and the results show comparable performance with conventional composite materials. An important operational advantage, however, is that side reactions leading to the deterioration of conductive filler in the electrode substrate material (i.e., electrode delamination due to CO2-evolution) during cell overcharging are eliminated, making these electrodes more durable than the conventional designs. To date, these bipolar electrodes have been applied in vanadium redox cells but their design and properties promise further applications in a range of other redox flow batteries and bipolar electrochemical cell systems.},

  abstract = {Lithium ion batteries are used extensively in electronic devices as well as hybrid and electric vehicles. The anode electrode layer in the battery can be fabricated by coating an aqueous dispersion of carbon, binder, and additives, and then drying. During manufacturing, the distribution of the binder through the coating thickness can become nonuniform, which compromises the properties and performance of the battery. In this study, a quantitative method to analyze the binder distribution in the electrode during drying was established. A drying apparatus with an integrated analytic balance and surface-temperature measurement was used to prepare specimens. At specific time points during drying, specimens were removed from the apparatus, quickly frozen, and then freeze-dried. Raman spectroscopy was then used to measure the binder concentration at different points through the cross section of the freeze-dried electrode coating. Scanning electron microscopy was also used to explore the changing microstructure qualitatively. Using a model electrode formulation, the method demonstrated different binder distributions for electrodes dried at 150 C under airflow and room temperature, 20 C, with no airflow. The results also showed continued changes in distribution in the interior of the coating as drying continued. © 2013 American Coatings Association \& Oil and Colour Chemists' Association.},

Dramatic improvements in power densities have been achieved in both SOFC and PEMFC systems through reduction of the electrolyte thickness and architectural control of the composite electrodes. Current efforts are aimed at reducing SOFC costs by lowering operating temperatures to 500-800 °C, and reducing PEMFC system complexity be developing 'water-free' membranes which can also be operated at temperatures slightly above 100 °C. © 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

These results are far superior to those that have been used by researchers modelling cell failure mechanisms and as such, these results are more representative of modern Li-ion cells and should be adopted by modellers. Up to three years of testing has been completed for some of the tests. Tests include long-term charge-discharge cycling at 20, 40 and 55°C, long-term storage at 20, 40 and 55°C, and high precision coulometry at 40°C. Several different electrolytes are considered in this LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2/graphite chemistry, including those that can promote fast charging. The reasons for cell performance degradation and impedance growth are examined using several methods. We conclude that cells of this type should be able to power an electric vehicle for over 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) and last at least two decades in grid energy storage.

  abstract = {14 Most cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries exhibit a low electronic conductivity. Hence, a significant amount of conductive additives, commonly called carbon black and graphite are introduced during electrode production. The mechanical stability and electronic connection of the electrode is enhanced by a mixed phase formed by the carbon and binder materials. However, this mixed phase, the carbon binder domain (CBD), hinders the transport of lithium ions through the pore network. Thus, it reduces the performance at higher currents. In this work we combine microstructure resolved simulations with impedance measurements on symmetrical cells to identify the influence of the CBD distribution. Mi-crostructures of NMC622 electrodes are obtained through synchrotron X-ray tomography. However, resolving the CBD using tomography techniques is challenging. Therefore, three different distributions of the CBD phase are incorporated via a structure generator. For the first time we present results of microstructure resolved impedance spectroscopy simulations. The simulations are able to reproduce impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic lithiation measurements providing a link between the CBD distribution, electrode impedance, and half-cell performance. The simulations demonstrate the significance of the CBD distribution. The accumulation of CBD at contact points between particles is identified as the most likely configuration in the electrodes under consideration.},

  abstract = {Li-ion batteries (LIBs), commercialized in 1991, have the highest energy density among practical secondary batteries and are widely utilized in electronics, electric vehicles, and even stationary energy storage systems. Along with the expansion of their demand and application, concern about the resources of Li and Co is growing. Therefore, secondary batteries composed of earth-abundant elements are desired to complement LIBs. In recent years, K-ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted significant attention as potential alternatives to LIBs. Previous studies have developed positive and negative electrode materials for KIBs and demonstrated several unique advantages of KIBs over LIBs and Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Thus, besides being free from any scarce/toxic elements, the low standard electrode potentials of K/K+ electrodes lead to high operation voltages competitive to those observed in LIBs. Moreover, K+ ions exhibit faster ionic diffusion in electrolytes due to weaker interaction with solvents and anions than that of Li+ ions; this is essential to realize high-power KIBs. This review comprehensively covers the studies on electrochemical materials for KIBs, including electrode and electrolyte materials and a discussion on recent achievements and remaining/emerging issues. The review also includes insights into electrode reactions and solid-state ionics and nonaqueous solution chemistry as well as perspectives on the research-based development of KIBs compared to those of LIBs and NIBs.},

To ensure environmental sustainability, LIBs must be capable of performing well at extreme temperatures, that is, between −40 and 60 °C. In this review, the recent important progress and advances in the subzero and elevated temperature operations of LIBs is comprehensively summarized from a materials perspective. In the scenario of subzero temperatures, limitations, electrolytes, anodes, and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI); cathodes and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI); and binders are thoroughly discussed to explore the fundamentals and basics that underlie the decay in electrochemical performance and how the chemistry, physics, and electrochemistry are correlated with the materials and components that interact with each other. In the case of high temperatures limitations, the thermal stability of the key materials and components are reviewed, and then the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics of the anodes, cathodes, electrolytes, and their interactions are described using the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO), and are extensively discussed. The prospect of combining the extreme temperature poles in a single cell by introducing appropriate electrolytes and additives is discussed.},

In this work, electrochemical performance and parasitic losses are combined in an overall system-level efficiency metric for a high performance, all-vanadium redox flow battery. It was found that pressure drop and parasitic pumping losses are relatively negligible for high performance cells, i.e., those capable of operating at a high current density while at a low flow rate. Through this finding, the Equal Path Length (EPL) flow field architecture was proposed and evaluated. This design has superior mass transport characteristics in comparison with the standard serpentine and interdigitated designs at the expense of increased pressure drop. An Aspect Ratio (AR) design is discussed and evaluated, which demonstrates decreased pressure drop compared to the EPL design, while maintaining similar electrochemical performance under most conditions. This AR design is capable of leading to improved system energy efficiency for flow batteries of all chemistries.},

Additionally, a computational flow simulation is used to support the conclusions made from the experimental results. This study demonstrates that optimal flow field design is not simply related to the best architecture, but is instead a more complex interplay between architecture, electrode properties, electrolyte properties, and operating conditions which combine to affect electrode convective transport. For example, an interdigitated design outperforms a serpentine design at low flow rates and with a thin electrode, accessing up to an additional 30\% of discharge capacity; but a serpentine design can match the available discharge capacity of the interdigitated design by increasing the flow rate or the electrode thickness due to differing responses between the two flow fields. The results of this study should be useful to design engineers seeking to optimize VRB systems through enhanced performance and reduced pressure drop.},

  abstract = {Voltage fade is a major problem in battery applications for high-energy lithium- and manganese-rich (LMR) layered materials. As a result of the complexity of the LMR structure, the voltage fade mechanism is not well understood. Here we conduct both in situ and ex situ studies on a typical LMR material (Li 1.2 Ni 0.15 Co 0.1 Mn 0.55 O 2 ) during charge–discharge cycling, using multi-length-scale X-ray spectroscopic and three-dimensional electron microscopic imaging techniques. Through probing from the surface to the bulk, and from individual to whole ensembles of particles, we show that the average valence state of each type of transition metal cation is continuously reduced, which is attributed to oxygen release from the LMR material. Such reductions activate the lower-voltage Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ and Co 2+ /Co 3+ redox couples in addition to the original redox couples including Ni 2+ /Ni 3+ , Ni 3+ /Ni 4+ and O 2− /O − , directly leading to the voltage fade. We also show that the oxygen release causes microstructural defects such as the formation of large pores within particles, which also contributes to the voltage fade. Surface coating and modification methods are suggested to be effective in suppressing the voltage fade through reducing the oxygen release.},

The distribution of functional additives such as binder or carbon black throughout the film strongly depends on the drying process. A representative state-of-the-art model system comprising graphite, polymeric binder, carbon black and solvent is investigated to gain an insight into the underlying processes. A new experimental approach is introduced that allows for revelation of the evolution of binder concentration gradients throughout the film during drying. Binder is detected by means of energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) at the top and bottom surface. Drying kinetics is investigated and the impact of the drying process on electrochemical performance is disclosed. The enrichment of binder at the surface, which is observed while applying high drying rates, is shown to depend on two fundamental processes, namely capillary action and diffusion. The findings reveal characteristic drying stages that provide fundamental insights into film solidification. Based on that, a top-down consolidation mechanism capable of explaining the experimental findings is disclosed. Adhesion of the active layer to the substrate is shown to strongly depend on the local binder concentration in the vicinity of the substrate.},

  abstract = {Although the term ‘confinement’ regularly appears in electrochemical literature, elevated by continuous progression in the research of nanomaterials and nanostructures, up until today the various aspects of confinement considered in electrochemistry are rather scattered individual contributions outside the established disciplines in this field. Thanks to a number of highly original publications and the growing appreciation of confinement as an overarching link between different exciting new research strategies, ‘electrochemistry under confinement’ is the process of forming a research discipline of its own. To aid the development a coherent terminology and joint basic concepts, as crucial factors for this transformation, this review provides an overview on the different effects on electrochemical processes known to date that can be caused by confinement. It also suggests where boundaries to other effects, such as nano-effects could be drawn. To conceptualize the vast amount of research activities revolving around the main concepts of confinement, we define six types of confinement and select two of them to discuss the state of the art and anticipated future developments in more detail. The first type concerns nanochannel environments and their applications for electrodeposition and for electrochemical sensing. The second type covers the rather newly emerging field of colloidal single entity confinement in electrochemistry. In these contexts, we will for instance address the influence of confinement on the mass transport and electric field distributions and will link the associated changes in local species concentration or in the local driving force to altered reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Highlighting pioneering works and exciting recent developments, this educational review does not only aim at surveying and categorizing the state-of-the-art, but seeks to specifically point out future perspectives in the field of confinement-controlled electrochemistry.},

Here, we report an orthogonal, “one-pot” synthetic approach to prepare a sulfur-embedded polybenzoxazine (S-BOP) with a high sulfur content of 72 wt \%. This sulfur-embedded polymer was achieved via thermal ring-opening polymerization of benzoxazine in the presence of elemental sulfur, and the covalent attachment of sulfur to the polymer was rationally directed through the thiol group of benzoxazine. Also, the resulting S-BOP bears a homogeneous distribution of sulfur due to in situ formation of the polymer backbone.

  abstract = {Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are regarded as one of the most promising electrochemical technologies for grid-connected renewable energy storage systems. The performance of VRFBs, however, strongly depends on the membrane, one of the key components of VRFBs with critical dual functions of promotion of diffusion of active species (H+, H3O+, SO42−, or SO4H−) and inhibition of crossover of vanadium ions. This is intrinsically related to the microstructure of membranes. For example, large and connected ionic clusters or pores in membranes are favorable for the ion transfer, but detrimental to the ion selectivity. While small and isolated hydrophilic ion clusters or pores suppress the water uptake and ion transfer, the decreased swelling ratio would enhance chemical stability of membrane. Thus, comprehensive strategies are required to realize the optimal balance between the ion selectivity, proton conductivity, and chemical stability. This review focuses on the effects of microstructure of membranes on the ion transfer and the chemical stability, including introduction of the rigid groups, electron-withdrawing groups, and hydrophobic backbones, are reviewed. The prospect of the development of membranes with high ion selectivity and high-performance VRFBs is discussed.},

Lithium-air batteries (LABs), in particular, have shown a compelling case for researchers due to their highest energy density (3600 Wh kg−1). However, despite decades of the tremendous amount of studies, LABs are still not commercialized as a practical energy storage system due to unsolved issues related to cathode materials. In this review, we present the most recent progress in cathode materials functioning as free-standing electrodes. Significantly, materials and processing to address the complicated problem are discussed in each section. Also, this review includes a discussion of the current controversy about the principles of useful cathode materials regarding ORR, OER and stability, and future perspectives of research related to them. Because the realization of current LAB to practical application is poorly understood, this review emphasizes on initiating a hasty search for practical LABs and their applications. A summary and outlooks on the current limitations and recommended future research directions of LABs are also presented.},

The novel material was structurally characterized via near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and successful functionalization was proven. As the novel material is a potential candidate for catalyst support application in high-temperature proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs), thermal and electrochemical stability of the novel material was investigated. Measurements via thermogravimetric analysis coupled to a mass spectrometer (TGA-MS) showed that the indazole-functionalized CNTs are thermally stable until a temperature of approx. 300 °C is reached. The thermal degradation of the functional group was tracked by monitoring the evolution of NOX gases. Furthermore, electrochemical stability of the novel material was evaluated using high-temperature differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (HT-DEMS) under gas-phase conditions. Compared to unmodified CNTs, it was shown that the functionalization leads to a slightly increased electrochemical carbon corrosion. However, the indazole-functionalized CNTs show a higher electrochemical stability than carbon black (Vulcan XC72R) typically used as catalyst support in HT-PEMFCs. In comparison to unmodified CNTs, functionality tests of the indazole-functionalized CNTs showed a better dispersibility in water and a lower contact angle with concentrated H3PO4, which is the electrolyte in HT-PEMFCs. Ultimately, ion exchange capacity measurements showed that the indazole-functionalized CNTs are able to bind protons in the catalyst layer and, therefore, potentially improve the catalyst-electrolyte interface as well as the proton conductivity in the catalyst layer.},

Due to stringent quality requirements regarding the porous layer of active material control systems are implemented in the production line which are capable to detect contaminations and check the homogeneity of the active material film application. This work presents the active thermography as method for real time testing of electrodes' active layer thickness and basis weight. In experimental investigations a correlation between the electrodes' thermal characteristics and the geometry could be found, confirming that: First, thin films with a high porosity heat up faster, during thermal excitation, than thicker and more compressed films. Second, denser electrodes comprise a higher thermal conductivity and hence heat up and cool down slower than films comprising higher porosities. Both aspects are crucial findings and enable the development of innovative in-line electrode inspections systems.},

  abstract = {The research and development of advanced energy-storage systems must meet a large number of requirements, including high energy density, natural abundance of the raw material, low cost and environmental friendliness, and particularly reasonable safety. As the demands of high-performance batteries are continuously increasing, with large-scale energy storage systems and electric mobility equipment, lithium–sulfur batteries have become an attractive candidate for the new generation of high-performance batteries due to their high theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g−1) and energy density (2600 Wh kg−1). However, rapid capacity attenuation with poor cycle and rate performances make the batteries far from ideal with respect to real commercial applications. Outstanding breakthroughs and achievements have been made to alleviate these problems in the past ten years. This paper presents an overview of recent advances in lithium–sulfur battery research. We cover the research and development to date on various components of lithium–sulfur batteries, including cathodes, binders, separators, electrolytes, anodes, collectors, and some novel cell configurations. The current trends in materials selection for batteries are reviewed and various choices of cathode, binder, electrolyte, separator, anode, and collector materials are discussed. The current challenges associated with the use of batteries and their materials selection are listed and future perspectives for this class of battery are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Pressing challenges facing future lithium batteries include the realization of a high specific capacity, reliable cycle life, fast charging, and improved safety. Herein, cutting‐edge lithium–sulfur batteries based on sulfur‐rich polymers that demonstrate a high discharge capacity of 1346 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, a record‐high rate performance of 833 mAh g−1 at 10C, and long lifetime of 500 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.052\% per cycle are reported. These are realized via the linker‐controlled mass synthesis of sulfur‐rich polymers with the possible tuning of charge transfer properties and effective suppression of the polysulfide‐shuttle via chemical interactions. In particular, the use of tetra(allyloxy)‐1,4‐benzoquinone linker enables the conductivity enhancement by a factor of 450 and lithium diffusion kinetics improvement by two orders of magnitude during redox reactions, compared with elemental sulfur cathodes. This work overcomes fundamental limitations of organosulfur cathode materials, and could pave the way for the development of next‐generation lithium batteries.},

  abstract = {The surface of carbon felt electrodes has been modified for improving energy efficiency of vanadium redox flow batteries. For comparative purposes, the effects of various surface modifications such as mild oxidation, plasma treatment, and gamma-ray irradiation on the electrochemical properties of carbon felt electrodes were investigated at optimized conditions. The cell energy efficiency was improved from 68 to 75\% after the mild oxidation of the carbon felt at 500 ?C for 5 h. This efficiency improvement could be attributed to the increased surface area of the carbon felt electrode and the formation of functional groups on its surface as a result of the modification. On the basis of various structural and electrochemical characterizations, a relationship between the surface nature and electrochemical activity of the carbon felt electrodes is discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {To advance current Li rechargeable batteries further, tremendous emphasis has been made on the development of anode materials with higher capacities than the widely commercialized graphite. Some of these anode materials exhibit capacities above the theoretical value predicted based on conventional mechanisms of Li storage, namely insertion, alloying, and conversion. In addition, in contrast to conventional observations of loss upon cycling, the capacity has been found to increase during repeated cycling in a significant number of cases. As the internal environment in the battery is very complicated and continuously changing, these abnormal charge storage behaviors are caused by diverse reactions. In this review, we will introduce our current understanding of reported reactions accounting for the extra capacity. It includes formation/decomposition of electrolyte-derived surface layer, the possibility of additional charge storage at sharp interfaces between electronic and ionic sinks, redox reactions of Li-containing species, unconventional activity of structural defects, and metallic-cluster like Li storage. We will also discuss how the changes in the anode can induce capacity increase upon cycling. With this knowledge, new insights into possible strategies to effectively and sustainably utilize these abnormal charge storage mechanisms to produce vertical leaps in performance of anode materials will be laid out.},

A high concentration of oxygen functional groups has been successfully introduced onto the surface of the carbon felt electrodes by a specially designed surface treatment, which is mainly responsible for improving the energy efficiency of VRFBs. In addition, the wettability of the carbon felt electrodes also can be significantly improved. The energy efficiency of the VRFB cell employing the surface modified carbon felt electrodes is improved by 7\% at high current density (148 cm2). Such improvement is attributed to the faster charge transfer and better wettability allowed by surface-active oxygen functional groups. Moreover, this method is much more competitive than other surface treatments in terms of processing time, production costs, and electrochemical performance.},

Through direct surface modification with ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NH4PF6), phosphorus can be successfully incorporated onto the surface of the carbon felt by forming phosphate functional groups with -OH chemical moieties that exhibit good hydrophilicity. The electrochemical reactivity of the carbon felt toward the redox reactions of VO2+/VO2+ (in the catholyte) and V3+/V2+ (in the anolyte) can be effectively improved owing to the superior catalytic effects of the oxygen-rich phosphate groups. Furthermore, undesirable hydrogen evolution can be suppressed by minimizing the overpotential for the V3+ /V2+ redox reaction in the anolyte of the VRFB. Cell-cycling tests with the catalyzed electrodes show improved energy efficiencies of 88.2 and 87.2\% in the 1st and 20th cycles compared with 83.0 and 81.1 \%, respectively, for the pristine electrodes at a constant current density of 32 mAcm-2. These improvements are mainly attributed to the faster charge transfer allowed by the integration of the oxygen-rich phosphate groups on the carbon-felt electrode.},

Many practical applications are expected of this class of materials because of its analogy to aluminium oxonitride phases. A new approach to gallium oxonitride ceramics is a synthesis pathway starting from a precursor that provides gallium simultaneously bonded to nitrogen and oxygen on a molecular level. One suitable precursor is the dimethylamine adduct of gallium tris-(t-butoxide), Ga(O  t Bu)  3 -HNMe  2 . The optimization of the pyrolysis process was controlled by analyzing the nitrogen to oxygen content and the reduction of carbon content in the ceramic. The samples were investigated using FTIR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The degree of crystallinity was determined by transmission electron microscopy in combination with an electron energy loss spectrometer. The precursor-derived gallium oxonitride ceramic remains nanocrystalline up to 600 °C and reacts to GaN with the wurtzite type structure by loss of all oxygen in an ammonia atmosphere at temperatures above 600 °C. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  \&  Co.

These properties along with diffusion rates and ion storage mechanisms are highly dependent on nanostructures. This work uses reactive molecular dynamics simulations to examine lithium and sodium ion storage mechanisms and diffusion in lignin-based hard carbon model systems with varying nanostructures. It was found that sodium will preferentially localize on the surface of curved graphene fragments, while lithium will preferentially bind to the hydrogen dense interfaces of crystalline and amorphous carbon domains. The ion storage mechanisms are explained through ion charge and energy distributions in coordination with snapshots of the simulated systems. It was also revealed that hard carbons with small crystalline volume fractions and moderately sized sheets of curved graphene will yield the highest sodium-ion diffusion rates at similar to 10(-7) cm(2)/s. Self-diffusion coefficients were determined by mean square displacement of ions in the models with extension through a confined random walk theory.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a 2-D transient, isothermal model of a vanadium redox flow battery that can predict the species crossover and related capacity loss during operation. The model incorporates the species transport across the membrane due to convection, diffusion, and migration, and accounts for the transfer of water between the half-cells to capture the change in electrolyte volume. The model also accounts for the side reactions and associated changes in species concentration in each half-cell due to vanadium crossover. A set of boundary conditions based on the conservations of flux and current are incorporated at the electrolyte|membrane interfaces to account for the steep gradients in concentration and potential at these interfaces. In addition, the present model further improves upon the accuracy of existing models by incorporating a more complete version of the Nernst equation, which enables accurate prediction of the cell potential without the use of a fitting voltage. A direct comparison of the model predictions with experimental data shows that the model accurately predicts the measured voltage of a single charge/discharge cycle with an average error of 1.83\%, and estimates the capacity loss of a 45 cycle experiment with an average error of 4.2\%. The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is an emerging energy storage technology that offers unique solutions for smart grid appli-cations, such as renewable energy storage, peak shaving, and electric utility load leveling. In these systems, liquid electrolytes are stored in external tanks and circulated through a cell stack, where the energy conversion process occurs due to electrochemical reduction-oxidation reactions. These reactions occur on porous graphite felt electrodes which are separated by an ion exchange membrane. The role of the membrane is to keep the solutions separate while allowing for the transfer of H + protons to maintain electroneutrality in the electrolytes. The key advantage of the VRFB is the that energy storage and power generation are decoupled, such that the energy storage capacity is de-termined by the volume of the external tanks, and the power rating is determined by the geometry and number of the electrochemical cells. Among the flow battery types, the VRFB distinguishes itself by using different oxidation states of the same vanadium element in the redox reactions. 1 During charge/discharge of a VRFB, the redox reactions occur simultaneously in both half-cells as follows: V 3+ + e}

  abstract = {A numerical method for calculating the mass transfer coefficient in fibrous media is presented. First, pressure driven flow was modelled using the Lattice Boltzmann Method. The advection-diffusion equation was solved for convective-reacting porous media flow, and the method is contrasted with experimental methods such as the limiting current diffusion technique, for its ability to determine and simulate mass transfer systems that are operating at low Reynolds number flows. A series of simulations were performed on three materials; specifically, commercially available carbon felts, electrospun carbon fibers and electrospun carbon fibers with anisotropy introduced to the microstructure. Simulations were performed in each principal direction (x,y,z) for each material in order to determine the effects of anisotropy on the mass transfer coefficient. In addition, the simulations spanned multiple Reynolds and Péclet numbers, to fully represent highly advective and highly diffusive systems. The resulting mass transfer coefficients were compared with values predicted by common correlations and a good agreement was found at high Reynolds numbers, but less so at lower Reynolds number typical of cell operation, reinforcing the utility of the numerical approach. Dimensionless mass transfer correlations were determined for each material and each direction in terms of the Sherwood number. These correlations were analyzed with respect to each materials’ permeability tensor. It was found that as the permeability of the system increases, the expected mass transfer coefficient decreases. Two general mass transfer correlations are presented, one correlation for isotropic fibrous media and the other for through-plane flow in planar fibrous materials such as electrospun media and carbon paper. The correlations are Sh = 0.879 Re 0.402 Sc 0.390 and Sh = 0.906 Re 0.432 Sc 0.432 respectively.},

Results show that the pressure drop is significantly higher than what can be expected in the thick electrode case while its electrochemical performance is lower. Detailed flow analysis using computational fluid dynamics simulations in two different flow fields shows that both these results can be attributed to electrode intrusion into the flow channel leading to increased resistance to electrolyte flow through the electrode. A correlation is proposed to evaluate electrode intrusion depth as a function of compression.},

In this review article we examine the recent progress and some of the challenges in the syntheses and modification of graphene-based materials, including energy storage applications as electrodes in Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Various synthesis routes have been used for obtaining graphene using different kinds of carbon sources (graphite, non-graphitic carbon and carbon-containing materials). The most popular processing methods include epitaxial growth, liquid phase chemical/electrochemical exfoliation, mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition and laser-assisted synthesis. Taking the reduction approach, chemical, thermal, microwave and laser reduction methods have been applied to prepare graphene from graphene oxide/graphite oxide. Recent research has shown that graphene derivatives and hybrids/ nanocomposites using metal oxides/mixed metal oxides and metal sulfides/mixed metal sulphides can have a profound impact on the performance of energy storage devices. Closing the text, we speculate on the future prospects for the application of graphene and its derivatives in energy storage devices. We expect that this review article will help in generating new insights for further development and practical applications of graphene-based materials.},

  abstract = {In order to improve the surface properties of carbon fiber without affecting the mechanical properties of the reinforcing fibers, various monomers (pyrrole (Py), carbazole (Cz) and thiophene (Th)) were used to electrograft conjugated copolymers. The electrocoated carbon fibers were characterized with respect to their surface morphology and surface composition, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and FTIR-reflectance spectroscopy, respectively. In general very homogeneous and continuous coated carbon fiber surfaces were obtained. The pH-dependent zeta (ζ)-potential measurements were applied to characterize the surface properties of all electrocoated fibers. The performed ζ-potential measurements reflect that the surface state is strongly dependent not only on the composition of the grafted polymers (different homopolymers, copolymers and a single terpolymer), but also on the extent of doping by the counter ion from the supporting electrolyte. Polymers or copolymers formed in solution during the electrografting process were also analyzed using FTIR-reflectance, 1H NMR and UV-VIS spectroscopy, as well by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and elemental analysis. Such a detailed investigation of well known electrografted copolymers opens the possibility to use such 'superior' materials in the field of carbon fiber reinforced polymeric composite materials. The main advantages of such homogeneous and dense electrocoatings are their thermal stability and the fact that one can design the surface composition and morphology. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Carbon felt electrodes for vanadium redox flow batteries are obtained by the graphitization of polyacrylonitrile based felts at different temperatures. Subsequently, the surface of the felts is modified via thermal oxidation at various temperatures. A single-cell experiment shows that the voltage efficiency is increased by this treatment. Electrode potentials measured with reference electrode setup show that this voltage efficiency increase is caused mainly by a reduction of the overpotential of the negative half-cell reaction. Consequently, this reaction is investigated further by cyclic voltammetry and the electrode activity is correlated with structural and surface chemical properties of the carbon fibers. By Raman, X-ray photoelectron and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy the role of edge sites and oxygen containing functional groups (OCFs) for the electrochemical activity are elucidated. A significant activity increase is observed in correlation with these two characteristics. The amount of OCFs is correlated with structural defects (e.g. edge sites) of the carbon fibers and therefore decreases with an increasing graphitization degree. Thus, for the same thermal oxidation temperature carbon fibers graphitized at a lower temperature show higher activities than those graphitized at a higher temperature.},

These composites are subsequently demonstrated as the active component for sodium ion battery anode. To synthesize the composites, we dissolved/dispersed titanium oxide (anatase) nanoparticles (for sodium insertion) and poly(hydroxybutyl methacrylate) (PHBMA, porogen) in furfuryl alcohol (carbon precursor) containing a photoacid generator (PAG). UV exposure converts the PAG to a strong acid that catalyzes the furfuryl alcohol polymerization. This polymerization simultaneously decreases the miscibility of the PHBMA and reduces the mobility in the mixture to kinetically trap the phase separation. Carbonization of this polymer composite yields a porous nanocomposite. This nanocomposite exhibits nearly 3-fold greater gravimetric capacity in Na-ion batteries than the same titanium oxide nanoparticles that have been coated with carbon. This improved performance is attributed to the morphology as the carbon content in the composite is five times that of the coated nanoparticles. The porous composite materials exhibit stable cyclic performance. Moreover, the battery performance using materials from this polymerization-induced phase separation method is reproducible (capacity within 10\% batch-to-batch). This simple fabrication methodology may be extendable to other systems and provides a facile route to generate reproducible hierarchical porous morphology that can be beneficial in energy storage applications.},

However, they suffer from a drop in the energy efficiency induced by the large activation polarization during vanadium redox reactions. In this study, we designed electrode materials with a high energy efficiency that are a macroporous monolith composed of three-dimensionally entangled graphitic nanoribbons. These materials were denoted as macroporous graphitic nanowebs (M-GNWs), possessing a high specific surface area of 213 m 2 g −1 and a large pore volume of 0.82 cm 3 g −1 . A large number of oxygen functional groups (C/O ratio of 4.4) were introduced after immersing the M-GNWs in the acidic electrolyte used in VRFBs. These properties of M-GNWs led to beneficial electrochemical catalytic effects such as low anodic and cathodic peak potential separation (△E p ) values of ∼73.4 mV (catholyte) in a cyclic voltammetry test conducted at a sweep rate of 2 mV s −1 . Furthermore, the VRFBs based on an M-GNW anode and cathode pair exhibited a significantly improved energy efficiency of 85.8\%, which is 12.4\% higher than that (73.4\%) of the commercial carbon felt-based VRFBs.},

Here, the electrode-electrolyte interactions and the charging of FePt alloy films in LiPF 6 in dimethyl carbonate(DMC)-ethylene carbonate (EC) are analysed in comparison to the pure metals Fe and Pt. The main electrode processes are Li deposition and dissolution, Fe dissolution and redeposition, and reduction as well as oxidation processes of impurities and electrolyte. Fe is found to be more stable against anodic dissolution in FePt films. Pt attenuates electrode passivation and catalyses impurity reduction reactions. This results in a cathodic potential limit of 1.8 V vs. Li/Li + for charging FePt films without side reactions. Subsequently, ultrathin textured FePt films promising large voltage induced magnetic surface effects where used as electrodes. Magnetic properties during charging were monitored by an in situ setup based on the anomalous Hall effect. Marginal Fe dissolution at the surface above 3 V vs. Li/Li + is detected by the in situ measurement and limits the upper charging potential. In consequence, a potential window of 1.2 V for charging the FePt films is obtained. In this potential range a large reversible change of magnetic moment is detected, which is attributed to reversible redox processes in the native iron oxide surface layer. © 2012 El sevier Ltd.

The chemical environment of the nitrogen atoms is gradually changed during the electrochemical cycle, indicating the breaking of S-N bonds. The ionic liquid solvent remains mostly as an ion pair, but some decomposition into PP13 cations and TFSI anions cannot be ruled out.

  abstract = {The valence electronic structures of Li2CO3, Li2O, Li2O2, and LiOH were determined by soft X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) at the oxygen K-edge. To ensure the collection of representative high-quality spectra, beam damage effects were characterized, and their influence on the spectral characteristics was minimized by limiting the exposure time (i.e., scanning the sample under the X-ray beam). We find that the spectral shapes of the four spectra are very compound-specific and allow an unambiguous speciation of these compounds. The emission lines are discussed and assigned based on published calculated oxygen-derived partial density of states. It is shown that the oxygen emission of Li2CO3, Li2O, Li2O2, and LiOH in the upper valence band is mainly related to the s- and p-like states of the carbonate anion CO32-, the p-like states of the oxide anion O2-, the p-like states of the peroxide anion O22-, and the π-like character of the OH- group, respectively. This work thus creates the basis for XES studies of the chemical reaction mechanism in energy storage devices involving these key compounds. (Graph Presented).}

  abstract = {Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have emerged as prime candidates for energy storage on the medium and large scales, particularly at the grid scale. The demand for versatile energy storage continues to increase as more electrical energy is generated from intermittent renewable sources. A major barrier in the way of broad deployment and deep market penetration is the use of expensive metals as the active species in the electrolytes. The use of organic redox couples in aqueous or non-aqueous electrolytes is a promising approach to reducing the overall cost in long-term, since these materials can be low-cost and abundant. The performance of such redox couples can be tuned by modifying their chemical structure. In recent years, significant developments in organic redox flow batteries has taken place, with the introduction of new groups of highly soluble organic molecules, capable of providing a cell voltage and charge capacity comparable to conventional metal-based systems. This review summarises the fundamental developments and characterization of organic redox flow batteries from both the chemistry and materials perspectives. The latest advances, future challenges and opportunities for further development are discussed.},

The most relevant example is the graphite anode for rechargeable Li-ion batteries which has been commercialized in 1991 and still represents the benchmark anode in Li-ion batteries 30 years later. Learning from past lessons on alkali metal intercalation in graphite, recent breakthroughs in sodium and potassium intercalation in graphite have been demonstrated for Na-ion batteries and K-ion batteries. Interestingly, some significant differences proved to exist for the intercalation of Na+ and K+ into graphite compared with the Li+ case. Such different host-guest interactions are unique depending on the host materials and electrolytes, which greatly contribute to a deeper understanding of intercalation-type electrode materials for next generation alkali metal ion batteries. This review summarizes significant advances from both experimental and theoretical calculations with a focus on comparing the intercalation of three alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+) into graphite and aims to clarify the intimate host-guest relationships and the underlying mechanisms. New approaches developed to achieve favorable intercalation coupled with the challenges in this field are also discussed. We also extrapolate alkali metal ion intercalation in graphite to mono-/multi-valent ions in layered electrode materials, which will deepen the understanding of intercalation chemistry and provide guidance to explore new guests and hosts.},

  abstract = {Hard carbon is the most attractive anode in Na-ion batteries. The performance of hard carbon relies primarily on the precursors and the synthesis approaches. Lignin, as the second-abundant biopolymer in nature, with the low cost and high carbon yield makes it an ideal precursor for the preparation of hard carbon. However, lignin-derived hard carbon from direct carbonization shows poor electrochemical performance. A low-temperature pre-oxidation is applied in this study to introduce carbonyl groups for enhancing the crosslink of lignin. Consequently, the growth and orientation of graphitic layers during carbonization are inhibited, which in turn increases the layer distance for facilitating the Na ion insertion and leads to exceptional rate capability and superb cyclic life. To gain insights into the charge storage mechanism, a comparison with Li- and K-ion storage in hard carbon is conducted through in-situ Raman tests. There are similarities of alkali-metal ion storage at high voltages but remarkable disparities at low voltages, thus emphasizing the importance of microstructure design of hard carbon depending on the application in various metal-ion batteries.

Fundamental correlations led to a new model to explain the morphological evolution and its effects on the electrocatalytic activity in vanadium flow batteries.           ,                             Thermal activation of graphite felts has proven to be a valuable technique for electrodes in vanadium flow batteries to improve their sluggish reaction kinetics. In the underlying work, a novel approach is presented to describe the morphological, microstructural, and chemical changes that occur as a result of the activation process. All surface properties were monitored at different stages of thermal activation and correlated with the electrocatalytic activity. The subsequently developed model consists of a combined ablation and damaging process observed by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Initially, the outermost layer of adventitious carbon is removed and sp               2               layers of graphite are damaged in the oxidative atmosphere, which enhances the electrocatalytic activity by introducing small pores with sharp edges. In later stages, the concentration of reaction sites does not increase further, but the defect geometry changes significantly, leading to lower activity. This new perspective on thermal activation allows several correlations between structural and functional properties of graphite for the vanadium redox couple, describing the importance of structural defects over surface chemistry.},

ORFBs utilize earth-abundant and potentially cost-effective organic redox-active molecules (ORMs), and have rapidly gained scientific interest. Transitioning from aqueous (Aq) solvents to NAq electrolytes expands the stable electrochemical windows available in ORFBs, thus offering great potential to increase both power density and energy density. To combine the advantages of ORMs and NAq electrolytes, non-aqueous organic redox flow batteries (NAqORFBs) have emerged. Recent advances in NAqORFBs have focused on the development of ORMs with large redox potential differences, multi-electron transfer capabilities, improved solubility, and stability. Strategies for preventing the crossover of redox-active species have also been documented. Collectively, these studies potentiate NAqORFBs as an important approach for sustainable energy storage. Still greater opportunities to further increase the battery performance through increased energy density, energy efficiency, and cycling lifetime can be realized by molecular engineering of ORMs and rational design of battery cells. We, therefore, review the critical principles that need to be considered in engineering NAqORFBs, and conclude with a discussion of emerging possibilities in these areas.},

The proposed fluidic networks employ periodic throttling of the flow to optimally deflect the electrolytes into the porous electrode, targeting enhancement of the electrolyte-electrode interaction. Theoretical analysis is conducted with channels in the form of trapezoidal waves, confirming and detailing the mass transport enhancement mechanism. In dilute concentration experiments with an alkaline quinone redox chemistry, a scaling of the limiting current with Re 0.74 is identified, which compares favourably against the Re 0.33 scaling typical of diffusion-limited laminar processes. Experimental IR-corrected polarization curves are presented for high concentration conditions, and a significant performance improvement is observed with the narrowing of the nozzles. The adverse effects of periodic throttling on the pumping power are compared with the benefits in terms of power density, and an improvement of up to 102\% in net power density is obtained in comparison with the flow-by case employing straight parallel channels. The proposed novel concept of corrugated fluidic networks comes with facile fabrication and contributes to the improvement of the transport characteristics and overall performance of redox flow battery systems.},

  abstract = {Lithium metal is a promising anode material with extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3,860 mA h g−1), low density (0.59 g cm−3), and the lowest negative electrochemical potential of all potential candidates (−3.04 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode). However, uncontrollable Li dendrite growth leads to a short lifespan and catastrophic safety hazards, which has restricted its practical application for many years. Some effective strategies have been adopted regarding these challenges, including electrolyte modification, introducing a protective layer, nanostructured anodes, and membrane modification. Carbon-based materials have been demonstrated to significantly address the challenge of Li dendrites. In this review, carbon-based materials and their application and challenges in lithium metal anode protection have been discussed in detail. In addition, the applications of lithium anodes protected by carbon-based materials in Li-S batteries and Li-O2 batteries have been summarized.},

  abstract = {Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) have been established as a key component in industrial water desalination and electrolysis processes. Thus, nowadays, they are being studied and developed for application in new energy conversion and storage systems as well as efficient desalination and wastewater treatment processes. These processes include redox flow batteries, reverse electrodialysis, membrane capacitive deionization, microbial fuel cells, and ion exchange membrane bioreactors. Ion permselectivity between counter- and co-ions, the most essential property in IEMs, makes these processes possible and/or efficient. Additionally, ion selectivity between different counter-ions is required for these novel processes to be efficient. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of ion exchange membrane permselectivity by summarizing the developments in this field over the past decade. Membrane microstructure and possible mechanisms for ion transport in the membrane phase are discussed with respect to permselectivity, along with the influence of current density and related membrane-solution boundary conditions. A selectivity order for the transport of common anions through conventional anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is generalized, the same is done for cation transport through conventional cation exchange membranes (CEMs). Two types of experimental methods for the determination of ion permselectivity: electrodialysis and the membrane potential method, are summarized. Finally, relevant membrane preparation methods and surface modification of IEMs reported over the past decade are classified and discussed. In summary, we conclude that synthetic methods have evolved rapidly; however, development of fundamental knowledge on the many complex phenomena occurring in the adaptive membrane bulk and solution-interface environments is not sufficiently established. Thus, much effort is required to combine experimental, theoretical, and simulation data for a more comprehensive and coherent understanding of these phenomena.},

Following a simple measuring procedure, the system allows nondestructive, highly reproducible, and rapid data acquisition.

These results demonstrate that an initial determination of resistance values in battery electrodes is beneficial especially if it is combined with an electrical postmortem analysis of cycled cathode disks.

  abstract = {Lithium metal has been considered to be the most promising anode material for the new generation of energy-storage system. However, challenges still stand in protecting lithium metal from spontaneous reactions with electrolytes and preventing the dendritic propagation, both of which would lead to undesirable decrease in Coulombic efficiency. Polysulfone (PSf) membrane with high rigidity and free-volume cavities of approximately 0.3 nm was employed to provide a stable interface on the surface of anodic electrode. The isotropic channels were constructed by the interconnected and uniformly distributed free volumes in the polymer matrix, and were expected to be swelled by solvent molecules and anions of lithium salt and to allow Li+ ions to pass through onto the electrode surface. As a result, dendrite-free morphology of deposited lithium was observed. The stabilized interface arose from the PSf film was verified by the promoted performances of Cu|Li cells and steady voltage polarization of Li|Li cells. The full cell with PSf coated anode exhibited excellent cyclability (85\% capacity retention rate over 400 cycles at 1 C) and an outstanding rate capability (117 mAh g−1 at 5 C). The beneficial performances were further verified by the EIS results. This work provides a new strategic idea to settle the dendritic problems of Li metal anodes.},

The profiling was performed by synchrotron radiation based hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, HAXPES, and soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, SOXPES. In this way, the probing depth was varied over a wide range in the order of 2-50 nm. Both more surface and more bulk sensitive investigations than possible using traditional in-house X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) could thus be performed. The composition and morphology of the lithiated graphite anode/electrolyte interface (solid electrolyte interphase, SEI) and the delithiated lithium iron phosphate cathode/electrolyte interface (solid permeable interface, SPI) were compared. In the vicinity of the highly reductive graphite active material in the SEI, low binding energy components like Li2O were found while no obvious composition gradients were observed in the SPI. Both in the cathode SPI and the anode SEI, significant amounts of C-O and P-F containing compounds were found to deposit during cycling. Evidence for mixing of the porous binder and other SEI/SPI components was observed in both the anode and cathode electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The lithiated graphite SEI was estimated to be of the order of two tens of nanometers, while the cathode SPI thickness was estimated to a few nanometers only. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface oxidation is a typical treatment to form oxygen-containing surface functional groups on carbon fiber electrodes of redox flow batteries in order to enhance the performance, which has attracted much attention as a large-scale electric energy storage system. At present, however, little attention has been paid to the effect of the edge plane exposure. In this study, fine etching of the graphitized carbon fiber surface was attained by coating the surface with a metal-containing carbonaceous thin film and thermal oxidation. The etching was caused by the catalysis of the metal species; the mechanism and the effect of the carbonaceous film were demonstrated by in situ X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The finely etched surface possessed substantially enriched edge planes and an enhanced activity for the positive and negative electrode reactions of the vanadium redox flow battery. The flow cell test with the carbon fiber electrodes after the tuned etching showed a significant decrease in the overpotential and increase in the efficiency as well as stable cycling performance.},

This technique produces "fast-prepared" membranes with nanoscale structure, which allows to adequately address specific tuning of their porosity, platinum loading, electronic conductivity, and proton conductivity. Pt nanoparticles were attached to the PANI-F in a reaction of selective heterogeneous nucleation. After functionalization, Pt/PANI-F were assembled with Nafion™. Microscopic investigation revealed that functionalized polyaniline fibers formed a highly porous yet tight network of interpenetrating conductors connected to the catalytic Pt particles. The Pt/PANI-F LBL ultrathin MEA demonstrated a power densitiy of 63 mW cm-2 and yielded a Pt utilization of 437.5 W g-1 Pt which is comparable to the traditional fuel cell using carbon black as Pt support.

We synthesize two highly soluble phenothiazine derivatives, N-(2-methoxyethyl)phenothiazine (MEPT) and N-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl]phenothiazine (MEEPT), via a one-step synthesis from inexpensive precursors. Synthesis and isolation of the radical-cation salts permit UV-vis decay studies that illustrate the high stability of these open-shell species. Cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis experiments reveal the promising electrochemical properties of MEPT and MEEPT under dilute conditions. A high performance non-aqueous flow cell, employing interdigitated flow fields and carbon paper electrodes, is engineered and demonstrated; polarization and impedance studies quantify the cell's low area-specific resistance (3.2-3.3 Ω cm 2 ). We combine the most soluble derivative, MEEPT, and its tetrafluoroborate radical-cation salt in the flow cell for symmetric cycling, evincing a current density of 100 mA cm -2 with undetectable capacity fade over 100 cycles.

Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (NAqRFBs) are a promising, but nascent, concept for cost-effective grid-scale energy storage. While most studies report new active molecules and proof-of-concept prototypes, few discuss cell design. The direct translation of aqueous RFB design principles to nonaqueous systems is hampered by a lack of materials-specific knowledge, especially concerning the increased viscosities and decreased conductivities associated with nonaqueous electrolytes. To guide NAqRFB reactor design, recent techno-economic analyse s have established an area specific resistance (ASR) target of  {$<$} 5 Ω cm 2 . Here, we employ a state-of-the-art vanadium flow cell architecture, modified for compatibility with nonaqueous electrolytes, and a model ferrocene-based redox couple to investigate the feasibility of achieving this target ASR. We identify and minimize sources of resistive loss for various active species concentrations, electrolyte compositions, flow rates, separators, and electrode thicknesses via polarization and impedance spectroscopy, culminating in the demonstration of a cell ASR of ca. 1.7 Ω cm 2 . Further, we validate performance scalability using dynamically similar cells with a ten-fold difference in active areas.

  abstract = {Carbon-based electrodes are usually used in vanadium redox flow batteries and electrochemical performance of these electrodes can be modified by electrocatalysts. In the current study, reduced graphene oxide inks with different concentrations were used to modify a carbon felt electrode. It was observed that CF which was modified in 2 mg/ml ink (CF-G-2) had the optimum combination of electrochemical properties, because no significant peak current improvement was observed at higher graphene contents and it also had the minimum value of ΔEp. The anodic and cathodic peak currents for positive redox couple reaction in CF-G-2 reached to 45.3 and 21.1 mA respectively, in comparison with 14.2 and 4.7 mA values for bare felt. Linear diffusion coefficient was also enhanced more than two times with the incorporation of graphene. Nyquist plots of CF-G in different electrolytes (VOSO4/V2O5 and VOSO4) showed different shapes and equivalent circuit data indicated much lower charge transfer resistance for modified carbon felts with graphene. The diffusion process was remarkably facilitated with the incorporation of reduced graphene oxide and graphene had desirable influence on the electrolyte absorption of carbon felt. Finally, scanning electron micrographs of electrodes demonstrated loaded graphene nanosheets on the surface of carbon felt fibers.},

The electrical, electrochemical and surface properties of the graphite-felt electrodes are investigated in order to determine the contribution and effect of each deterioration mechanism to the loss in cell performance during overcharge. The electrical resistivity of the electrodes and the cell resistance show a slight increase after overcharge. The effect of overcharge on the surface chemistry of three types of graphite-felt electrodes is investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS analysis reveal a slight increase in the overall surface oxygen content of the graphite felts after overcharge, together with a shift to higher oxidation states that is consistant with the formation of C-OH, -CO, -COOH and -COOR groups. The proportion of each of these groups varies between graphite-felt types. The measured change in the relative concentrations of surface oxygen functional groups on the graphite felt is believed to be responsible for the observed increase in the electrical resistivity and electrochemical activity of the electrode materials during cell overcharge. © 1994.},

This study provides a systematic investigation correlating the different plausible defects (agglomeration/blisters, pinholes/divots, metal particle contamination, and non-uniform coating) in a LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 positive electrode with its electrochemical performance. In addition, an infrared thermography technique was demonstrated as a nondestructive tool to detect these defects. The findings show that cathode agglomerates aggravated cycle efficiency, and resulted in faster capacity fading at high current density. Electrode pinholes showed substantially lower discharge capacities at higher current densities than baseline NMC 532electrodes. Metal particle contaminants have an extremely negative effect on performance, at higher C-rates. The electrodes with more coated and uncoated interfaces (non-uniform coatings) showed poor cycle life compared with electrodes with fewer coated and uncoated interfaces. Further, microstructural investigation provided evidence of presence of carbon-rich region in the agglomerated region and uneven electrode coating thickness in the coated and uncoated interfacial regions that may lead to the inferior electrochemical performance. This study provides the importance of monitoring and early detection of the electrode defects during LIB manufacturing processes to minimize the cell rejection rate after fabrication and testing.},

  abstract = {Non-destructive, in-line quality control methods were adopted for evaluating the thickness and homogeneity of wet and dry lithium secondary battery electrodes. Laser caliper and infrared (IR) thermography methods were implemented in a systematic fashion for the first time to evaluate the quality of electrodes during the coating process on a slot-die coater. Laser caliper sensors were mounted, aligned, and subsequently calibrated at the oven inlet of the coating line in order to examine the thicknesses of different cathodes and anodes. The effect of various factors such as substrate vibration, temperature, surface reflectivity and laser positions on the thickness measurement during slot-die coating were evaluated. The setup was used to monitor the wet thickness of the cathode and anode, and the precision of the in-line laser thickness measurement was determined to be less than ±2\%. Thickness deviation for cathodes was typically ±2.0-2.3\%, and for anodes it was typically ±2.2-2.6\%, which confirms excellent precision of the measurement. The homogeneity of the dried electrodes was also evaluated by IR thermography at the oven outlet of the coating line. Temperature profiles from thermography images of dry electrodes were carefully examined to detect any flaws and inhomogeneity present in the electrodes. An increase or decrease in the temperature profiles indicated defects/flaws in the electrodes that could not be observed in optical images. The techniques applied in this work will be helpful for detection of electrode flaws and contamination during large-scale manufacturing and to identify flawed product prior to lithium-ion cell assembly. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Up to now, little evidence has been shown as to why the performance suffers. Here, we investigate the influence of an inhomogeneous binder distribution on the total ionic resistance within an electrode. First, we model the impact that vertical inhomogeneities have on the impedance spectrum and the total resistance of an RC (resistor, capacitor) transmission line model. We show how different resistance profiles lead to characteristic changes in the impedance spectrum, in phase angle and magnitude, with high resistances close to the separator leading to a significantly increased overall resistance. We then show energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy cross section data for electrodes dried at different temperatures and give experimental evidence for the formation and extent of the binder gradients. These electrodes are then measured using blocking electrolyte electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a symmetric cell setup. It is demonstrated that, depending on the extent of the binder gradient, the phase angle changes and that just from impedance data one can detect binder gradients qualitatively without the need for other time-consuming analysis methods.},

In order to compute the stack losses, an equivalent circuit model of a VRFB cell was built from a 2D FEM multiphysics numerical model based on Comsol®, accounting for coupled electrical, electrochemical, and charge and mass transport phenomena. Shunt currents were computed inside the cells with 3D FEM models and in the piping and manifolds by means of equivalent circuits solved with Matlab®.

Via remote control these plates can be removed and a thermal neutron spectrum (mean energy at 28 meV) gets available for experiments. While the fission neutron spectrum is regularly used, some upgrades of the instrument are necessary to make the thermal neutron spectrum routinely available for user experiments. This includes additional equipment like a new sample stage and a second detector system foreseen to extend the capabilities of NECTAR. The current state of the instrumentation and necessary changes for the future thermal beam option and its usage for standard user experiments will be presented. First measurements were carried out with a temporary flight tube installed and a compact detector (510 mm × 180 mm x 180 mm) for thermal neutrons with a spatial resolution in the range of 100 μm. The feasibility of the thermal beam option could already be verified at an L/D ratio of 240 and a thermal neutron flux of 7.92·106 cm−2 s−1. The thermal neutron beam option adds a pure thermal neutron spectrum – Maxwell spectrum originating from the moderator without alteration by a secondary source or converter – to the energy ranges available for neutron imaging at MLZ instruments. It also offers a unique possibility to combine two quite different neutron energy ranges at a single instrument including their respective advantages.

Lignosulfonate, a water-soluble derivative of lignin, is environmentally benign, low cost and abundant as it is obtained from the byproduct of paper and biofuel manufacturing. The lignosulfonate utilizes the redox chemistry of quinone to store energy and undergoes a reversible redox reaction. Here, we paired lignosulfonate with Br2/Br-, and the full cell runs efficiently with high power density. Also, the large and complex molecular structure of lignin considerably reduces the electrolytic crossover, which ensures very high capacity retention.

Graphite anodes comprising carbon black and PVDF binder are subject to varying drying conditions during solvent removal in order to adjust different binder distributions; fluorine is used as a marker for the presence of PVDF. For electrodes of about 70 μm thickness the fluorine concentration is detected at the surface of the electrode film as well as at the interface between electrode film and current collector foil. It is clearly visible by EDS that increasing drying temperatures (and drying rates) result in an accumulation of binder at the surface and a corresponding depletion at the interface. It is demonstrated on the basis of ion-milled cross-sections of thick electrodes (ca. 400 μm) that a quantitative mapping of the binder distribution delivers additional information about concentration gradients in dependence of the drying parameters.},

  abstract = {Herein, we present a detailed study by N-2 sorption and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) of the carbonization and KOH activation of lignin for its application as active material for electrochemical energy storage. It has been observed that i) the carbonization of lignin above 700 degrees C leads to a hard carbon with a large amount of bulk (buried) fine structure microporosity and a good performance as Na-ion negative electrode, ii) when KOH activation is done after complete carbonization it is mainly increasing the accessibility of the initial bulk micro porosity, leading to a carbon with good performance as symmetric supercapacitor in aqueous electrolyte and iii) when carbonization and KOH activation are done simultaneously, a distinct pore structure is generated with a large amount of mesopores, suitable for symmetric supercapacitor in organic electrolyte. By combining SAXS, which is sensitive to bulk as well as surface porosity, and N-2 sorption which probes surface porosity, it has been possible to follow the intricate mechanism of microporosity development. Finally, it is believed that these results can be extrapolated to various biomass based precursors.},

Results of theoretical calculations made it possible to use cyclic voltammetry to measure standard rate constants for electron transfer. Thus, a system which appears reversible at one frequency may be made to exhibit kinetic behavior at higher frequencies, as indicated by increased separation of cathodic and anodic peak potentials. The standard rate constant for electron transfer is determined from this peak potential separation and frequency. The method provides an extremely rapid and simple way to evaluate electrode kinetics.

The resulting LCFs were characterized by tensile testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and confocal Raman spectroscopy. The microstructure is mainly amorphous carbon with some nanocrystalline domains. The strength and stiffness are inversely proportional to the carbonization temperature, while the LCFs carbonized at 1000°C exhibit a strength of 628 MPa and a stiffness of 37 GPa. Furthermore, the application potential of LCFs was evaluated as negative electrodes in a lithium-ion battery (LIB) by electrochemical cycling at different current rates in a half-cell setup. The capacity drops with the carbonization temperature and the LCFs carbonized at 1000°C have a capacity of 335 mAh g               −1               . All LCFs showed good cycling stability. Because of the mechanical integrity and conductivity of the LCFs, there is no need to apply current collectors, conductive additives or binders. The advantage is an increased gravimetric energy density compared to graphite, which is the most common negative electrode material. LCFs show a promising multifunctional behavior, including good mechanical integrity, conductivity and an ability to intercalate lithium for LIBs.},

  abstract = {Proton exchange membrane (PEM) based technologies (fuel cells and electrolysers) offer promising sustainable power generation and storage solutions for a diverse range of stationary and mobile applications. Unitised regenerative fuel cell (URFC) is an electrochemical cell that can operate both as a fuel cell (FC) and an electrolyser (E). However, for a widespread commercialisation, further improvements are required that address the durability, performance, and cost limitations. One of the main challenging components in developing URFCs is the gas diffusion layer (GDL) as it plays different vital roles, some of which are paradoxical in FC and E-modes. Therefore, in this paper, the published research on GDL of PEM-URFCs as well as relevant studies on PEM fuel cells and electrolysers are critically reviewed. The materials and novel methods to address the corrosion in E-mode are discussed. This is followed by presenting and discussing different properties of GDLs affecting the performance in FC and E-modes: i.e. porosity, thickness, pore size, transport properties, thermal and electrical conductivity, and the GDL compressibility. Finally, the main modifications of the GDLs, such as hydrophobisation and microporous layer application, to improve the performance of a URFC are analysed and discussed.},

This copolymerization is enabled by the conversion of sulfur radicals formed by thermolytic cleavage of S8 rings with allyl end-group. The formation of a C-S bond in the copolymer is characterized by a variety of methods, including NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy. The S-P3HT copolymer is applied as an additive to sulfur as cathode material in lithium-sulfur batteries and compared to the use of a simple mixture of sulfur and P3HT, in which sulfur and P3HT were not covalently linked. While P3HT is incompatible with elementary sulfur, the new S-P3HT copolymer can be well dispersed in sulfur, at least on the sub-micrometer level. Sulfur batteries containing the S-P3HT copolymer exhibit an enhanced battery performance with respect to the cycling performance at 0.5C (799 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles for S-P3HT copolymer versus only 544 mAh g-1 for the simple mixture) and the C-rate performance. This is attributed to the attractive interaction between polysulfides and P3HT hindering the dissolution of polysulfides and the charge transfer (proven by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) due to the homogeneous incorporation of P3HT into sulfur by covalently linking sulfur and P3HT.}

  abstract = {X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a key method for studying (electro-)chemical changes in metal-ion battery electrode materials. In a recent publication, we pointed out a conflict in binding energy (BE) scale referencing at alkali metal samples, which is manifested in systematic deviations of the BEs up to several eV due to a specific interaction between the highly reactive alkali metal in contact with non-conducting surrounding species. The consequences of this phenomenon for XPS data interpretation are discussed in the present manuscript. Investigations of phenomena at surface-electrolyte interphase regions for a wide range of materials for both lithium and sodium-based applications are explained, ranging from oxide-based cathode materials via alloys and carbon-based anodes including appropriate reference chemicals. Depending on material class and alkaline content, specific solutions are proposed for choosing the correct reference BE to accurately define the BE scale. In conclusion, the different approaches for the use of reference elements, such as aliphatic carbon, implanted noble gas or surface metals, partially lack practicability and can lead to misinterpretation for application in battery materials. Thus, this manuscript provides exemplary alternative solutions.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the most relevant interactions between various electrode materials in contact with different electrolyte solutions.

Their operation and design characteristics, hence their performance, are closely linked to the multiphase transport of mass, heat, and electricity in the cell constituents, a critical of which is the gas diffusion layer (GDL). The GDL's transport capability is represented by its effective transport properties: an effective diffusion coefficient for the diffusional transport of mass, absolute and relative permeabilities for the convective transport of mass, effective thermal conductivity for the heat transport, and effective electron conductivity for the electricity transport; in addition, surface wettability impacts the transport of liquid water. These transport properties depend on the GDL's mechanical, morphological, microstructural, and physical characteristics, which are in turn controlled by its materials and design parameters. This review article therefore focuses on the insights and comprehensive understanding of three critical issues of the GDLs: (i) their morphological, microstructural, and physical characteristics, (ii) ex- and in-situ characterization techniques for the determination of their effective transport and mechanical properties, and (iii) frequently used materials and design strategies and their relevant influences on the effective transport properties in order to achieve reliable and durable performance of PEM fuel cells with high power densities.},

Dissolving Li2S in organic electrolyte is a facile solution to maintain the active reaction interface between electrolyte and sulfur cathode, and thus address the above issues. Herein, ammonium salts are demonstrated as effective additives to promote the dissolution of Li2S to 1.25 M in DMSO solvent at room temperature. NMR measurements show that the strong hydrogen binding effect of N–H groups plays a critical role in dissolving Li2S by forming complex ligands with S2– anions coupled with the solvent’s solvating surrounding. Ammonium additives in electrolyte can also significantly improve the oxidation kinetics of Li2S, and therefore enable the direct use of Li2S as cathode material in Li–S battery system in the future. This provides a new approach to manage the solubility of lithium sulfides through cation coordination ...},

The degradation of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell has been extensively studied, and a number of review papers investigating the durability issue have already been published. However, the gas diffusion layer has rarely been examined, even though it might be a key factor for managing mass transport and two-phase flow while mechanically supporting a membrane-electrode assembly and a bipolar plate. This paper reviews the published works on the durability of the gas diffusion layer of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The degradation of the gas diffusion layer can be divided into mechanical degradation, including the compression force effect, freeze/thaw cycle effect, dissolution effect, and erosion effect, and chemical degradation, which consists of the carbon corrosion effect. Following these categories, the methods of accelerated stress tests, the degradation mechanisms, and the influential factors are investigated along with various measurements of gas diffusion layer properties and cell performances.},

Recently, particle based films were also implemented in the 3D printing technique, and are particularly important for use in aircraft, wind power, and the automotive industry when incorporated onto the surface of composite structures for protection against damages caused by a lightning strike. A crucial issue for the lightning protection area is to realize films with high homogeneity of electrical resistance where an in-situ noninvasive method has to be elaborated for quality monitoring to avoid undesirable financial and time costs. In this work the drying process of particle based films was investigated by high-frequency eddy current (HFEC) spectroscopy in order to work out an automated in-situ quality monitoring method with a focus on the electrical resistance of the films. Different types of particle based films deposited on dielectric and carbon fiber reinforced plastic substrates were investigated in the present study and results show that the HFEC method offers a good opportunity to monitor the overall drying process of particle based films. Based on that, an algorithm was developed, allowing prediction of the final electrical resistance of the particle based films throughout the drying process, and was successfully implemented in a prototype system based on the EddyCus® HFEC device platform presented in this work. This prototype is the first solution for a portable system allowing HFEC measurement on huge and uneven surfaces.},

The Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase (SEI) model for non-aqueous alkali-metal batteries constitutes a paradigm change in the understanding of lithium batteries and has thus enabled the development of safer, durable, higher-power and lower-cost lithium batteries for portable and EV applications. Prior to the publication of the SEI model (1979), researchers used the Butler-Volmer equation, in which a direct electron transfer from the electrode to lithium cations in the solution is assumed. The SEI model proved that this is a mistaken concept and that, in practice, the transfer of electrons from the electrode to the solution in a lithium battery, must be prevented, since it will result in fast self-discharge of the active materials and poor battery performance. This model provides [E. Peled, in “Lithium Batteries,” J.P. Gabano (ed), Academic Press, (1983), E. Peled, J. Electrochem. Soc., 126, 2047 (1979).] new equations for: electrode kinetics (i o and b), anode corrosion, SEI resistivity and growth rate and irreversible capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries. This model became a cornerstone in the science and technology of lithium batteries. This paper reviews the past present and the future of SEI batteries.},

  abstract = {4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonic acid (Tiron) and anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid (AQDS) are interesting redox couple for aqueous quinone-based redox flow batteries (QRFBs) because of their high solubility and good reaction reversibility in acidic condition. Tiron is rate determining material due to its slow reaction kinetics. To improve that, Tiron is transformed into 2,4,5,6-tetrahydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonic acid (TironA), which is effectively formed during the first cycle of QRFB. Once TironA is formed, a desirable two-electron redox reaction with stable and reproducible charge and discharge step of QRFB occurs, although the electron transfer of TironA is still lower than that of AQDS. To further facilitate that of TironA, oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) plasma treated carbon felt (CF) electrodes are suggested. Oxygen functional groups formed onto CF by O2 plasma become the active sites for redox reaction of TironA. As the amount of oxygen functional groups formed increases, the redox reactivity of TironA is enhanced. In contrast, when N2 plasma is used, pyrrolic N and quartenary N are mainly formed. With the formation, (i) hydrogen atoms within pyrrolic N act as proton donor and interact with oxygen groups of TironA and (ii) nitrogen cations within quartenary N interact with the negatively charged atoms of TironA by electrostatic interaction. Thus, both reaction kinetic of TironA and performance of QRFB increase. Regarding the performance of QRFB using N2 plasma-treated CF, its EE, discharging capacity and state of charge are 62\%, 17.3 Ahr·L-1 and 64.5\% for 50 cycle, which correspond to excellent achievements.},

An energy selective backscatter detector is used to localize carbon black and fluorine of PVDF. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between graphite, amorphous carbon and fluorine rich regions. Typically, an angular selective backscatter detector is employed to obtain an image providing the material contrast of the sample. Suitable materials for that detector are e.g. alloys to observe intermetallic phases, semiconductor for “channeling contrast”, or imaging SiO2 and Au nanoparticles in biological cells. However, this detector cannot be used to distinguish between light elements with low atomic numbers, such as C to P. In addition, the contrast of fluorine rich regions and graphite is poor in normal in-lens images due to the low difference of the atomic mass between C and F. The aim of this study is to enhance the contrast of fluorine rich regions to graphite to carbon black. Therefore, the energy selective backscatter detector is used and its advantages and setup is described. Finally this technique is applied to investigate 400 μm thick cross-sections of graphite electrodes dried at different temperatures and obtain the carbon black distribution.},

Using principal component analysis, we decomposed the series of Fe K-edge spectra into three components consisting of Fe, FeF 2 and a new phase, which was identified by comparison with theoretical X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra of model compounds with tetrahedral and octahedral V coordination and 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy to be the inverse spinel V[FeV]O 4 . From the calculations, we also identified the lithium vanadate Li x VO 2-x F x . Both Li x VO 2-x F x and V[FeV]O 4 have open crystal structures with the ability to reversibly store lithium in interstitial lattice sites, and the effect of these compounds on capacity and cyclic stability of the LiF/Fe(V 2 O 5 ) nanocomposites is discussed. © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

  abstract = {The reaction kinetics of VII/VIII and VIVO2+/VVO2+ redox on carbon electrodes in sulfuric acid limit the development of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) with high power and efficiency characteristics. Cyclic voltammetry and symmetric flow cell measurements on selectively masked graphite foil and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite electrodes revealed that edge carbon sites provide faster kinetics for VII/VIII and VIVO2+/VVO2+ redox than basal carbon, especially at low vanadium concentrations. The understanding was used to explain the marked enhanced kinetics of carbon paper electrodes with heat-treatments in air relative to that without, which was supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements that showed much higher amounts of surface functional groups on the heat-treated carbon upon exposure to the VV species in the electrolyte. Of particular significance to note is that markedly enhanced kinetics for the VII/VIII redox for the heat-treated carbon were found at both low and high vanadium concentrations, while similar enhancement was found for the VIVO2+/VVO2+ redox for low vanadium concentrations but much smaller increased kinetics were noted for high vanadium concentrations required for practical flow batteries. This result was further confirmed by symmetric flow cell measurements that show much higher currents for the VII/VIII electrolyte using heat-treated carbon in comparison to the as-received, while comparable currents were found for VIVO2+/VVO2+ electrolyte, indicating that the redox kinetics of VII/VIII can be limiting for VRFBs using as-received carbon (low edge carbon and oxygen functional groups). These findings provide new insights and strategies for carbon electrode designs for high-power VRFBs.}

Mass transfer limitations have been determined from experimental data, and a new correlation for mass transfer constant is proposed. Self-discharge of the battery resulting from crossover of vanadium ions through membrane is taken into account by the model as well. It is shown that Fick's law for diffusion describes crossover rather well. The crossover has a large impact on the battery voltage during discharge, but can be neglected during charge due to mutual compensation of diffusion and migration fluxes.

  abstract = {Electrodes used in electroanalysis, which are based on carbonaceous nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes or graphene, often exhibit large degrees of porosity. By systematically varying the morphology of functionalized graphene electrodes from nearly flat to highly porous, we demonstrate experimentally that minute amounts of electrode porosity have surprisingly significant effects on the apparent reaction kinetics as determined by cyclic voltammetry, both in the reversible and the irreversible regime. We quantify electrode porosity using a coulometric approach and, with the help of numerical simulations, determine the correlation between electrode pore volume and apparent electrode kinetics. We show that in the reversible and quasi-reversible regime, the voltamperometric response constitutes a superposition of thin film diffusion-related effects within the porous electrode and of the standard flat electrode response. For irreversible kinetics, however, we show that diffusive coupling between the electrode and the electrolyte can, under suitably chosen conditions, result in effective electrocatalytic behavior. Confirming past theoretical work by Compton and others, our experiments demonstrate that for a comparison of electroanalytical data obtained with different electrode materials it is not sufficient to only consider differences in the materials' chemical structure but equally important to take into account differences in electrode morphology. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

It is composed of three parts: a graphite felt (electrode), an adhesive conducting layer (ACL) and a flexible graphite plate (bipolar plate). The ACL connects the electrode with the bipolar plate to an assembly. By the evaluations of cost, resistivity, surface morphology, electrolyte permeation and single cell performance, this novel assembly demonstrates its applicability in VRB as evident in the following outcomes: (1) lowers the cost and area resistivity to about 10\% and 40\% of the conventional setups, respectively; (2) improves electrical conductivity to 4.97 mΩ cm as compared to over 100 mΩ cm of the carbon-plastic composite bipolar plate; (3) attains zero electrolyte permeation; and (4) achieves a higher energy efficiency of 81\% at a charge/discharge current density of 40 mA cm-2when employed in a VRB single cell, which is 73\% for the conventional setup.

This paper will summarize the causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies of cell reversal of PEMFC in detail. A description of potential change in the anode and cathode and the differences between local starvation and overall starvation are reviewed, which gives a framework for comprehending the origins of cell reversal. According to the root factor of cell starvation, i.e., fuel cells do not satisfy the requirements of electrons and protons of normal anode and cathode chemical reactions, we will introduce specific methods to mitigate or prevent fuel cell damage caused by cell reversal in the view of system management strategies and component material modifications.

Initial graphitic edge sites, OFGs and their electrochemical stability were examined using graphite felts, which were modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and activated with KOH. It is demonstrated that OFGs cannot exclusively be responsible for the electrocatalysis since they did not correlate to the electrochemical activity. The surface composition after electrochemical cycling in the positive half-cell was still different for all samples but did not reflect the performance either. However, a correlation was found between the activity and stable edge site defects. There was neither a correlation between the electrocatalytic activity and the amount of oxygen, nor for the kind of OFG in the negative half-cell. The oxygen concentration after electrochemistry was very similar, even more highlighting the importance of edge sites in the VIII/VII redox reaction. The results of this work indicate that the major electrocatalytic effect for both half-cell redox reactions is related to stable graphitic edge sites in sufficient quantity.},

Researchers implement surface-active OFGs to improve the electrocatalytic properties of graphite felt electrodes in vanadium flow batteries. Herein, we show that graphitic defects and not OFGs are responsible for lowering the activation energy barrier and thus enhance the charge transfer properties. This is proven by a thermal deoxygenation procedure, in which specific OFGs are removed before electrochemical cycling. The electronic and microstructural changes associated with deoxygenation are studied by quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy. The removal of oxygen groups at basal and edge planes improves the activity by introducing new active edge sites and carbon vacancies. OFGs hinder the charge transfer at the graphite–electrolyte interface. This is further proven by modifying the sp2 plane of graphite felt electrodes with oxygen-containing pyrene derivatives. The electrochemical evolution of OFGs and graphitic defects are studied during polarization and long-term cycling conditions. The hypothesis of increased activity caused by OFGs was refuted and hydrogenated graphitic edge sites were identified as the true reason for this increase.},

Due to the heterogeneity of the material, activity descriptors cannot always be evaluated with certainty because the introduction of defects is accompanied by a change in surface chemistry. Moreover, surface defects occur in multiple dimensions, and their occurrence and influence on catalysis must be separated. In this work, we have studied the surface of graphite felt electrodes by different methods in terms of morphology and chemistry to understand the electrocatalytic activity. We then defined the interaction between the surface and the electronic structure with particular emphasis on the work function and valence band. Using model catalysts with different architectures, we established correlations between the electrocatalytic activity and the size of the conjugation and the orientation of the edges. Finally, it was possible to link the level of the work function to the electrocatalytic activity.},

  abstract = {Rechargeable lithium-ion battery technology has revolutionized energy storage for small electronic devices. However, a deeper understanding is required of the interfaces present in such devices for this technology to continue to advance. While many insights into the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for lithium-ion systems have been collected from decades of study, many questions also remain. In particular, this work is interested in exploring SEI composition and its impact on electrolyte structure and dynamics. By using a previously tested classical molecular dynamics approach, the impact of the crystallinity of the SEI interface as well as its content of organic and inorganic species is assessed. It is found that the presence of an amorphous SEI results in the accumulation of ions at the interface, ordering of solvent molecules, and a slowing down of solvation dynamics. These behaviors are intensified when crystal surfaces from LiF and Li2CO3 are considered. In addition to these general observations, the changes in lithium and PF6- solvation structure are also considered as they approach the SEI interface. In both cases, the drive to aggregate arising from greater ion accumulation is shielded in part from interaction with the charged groups in the SEI interface. This competition is tilted toward salt aggregation in the case of crystalline SEI, suggesting a significantly different solvation environment than typically seen in bulk for adsorbed species.},

Here, metrology options for slurry coating are reviewed as well as opportunities for in-line integration, discussing the benefits of combining advanced metrology to provide comprehensive characterisation, improve understanding and feed into predictive design models. There is a comprehensive range of metrology which needs little improvement to provide the relevant quantifiable measures during coating, with one exception of particle sizing, where more precise, in-line measurement would be beneficial. However, there is a lack of studies that bring together the latest advancements in electrode coating metrology which is crucial to understanding the interdependency of myriad processing and product parameters.

But high-added value applications in the field of electrochemistry, such as hard carbon precursor in anodes for sodium ion batteries, become more and more mentioned as promising uses to investigate. The present study aims at evaluating the feasibility of using biochars from various biomass types for this application and drawing links between biomass properties and the resulting hard carbon electrochemical performance. To achieve this goal, hard carbons were obtained by high-temperature slow pyrolysis of four woody and agricultural biomasses. These hard carbons were prepared as anodes, characterized regarding structural and textural properties and finally tested during successive cycles to assess electrode performances and correlate them with biomass composition. Whatever biomass, the hard carbon could be used in cells and thus biomass appears as a promising feedstock for this application. However, there are apparent differences between biomasses concerning coulombic efficiency and to some extent, cycle stability. Hence resinous wood appears to be the most suitable precursor, while wheat straw would be the least one, probably because of its too high surface area or inorganic element content. Based on these observations, hypotheses were suggested about the influence of lignin and hemicelluloses composition as well as of inorganic elements. To our knowledge, this study is pioneering in proposing a systematic study approach to understand the influence of different biomass properties in a hard carbon electrode for sodium-ion batteries.},

Samples with low to moderate ash content ({$<$} 5 wmf\%) delivered hard carbons with high C purity, the turbostratic structure required, and therefore reversible capacities up to 314 mAh/g. These materials exhibited low N-2 ({$<$} 14 m(2)/g) and CO2 ({$<$} 66 m(2)/g) specific surface area (SSA), thus low irreversible loss, with initial coulombic efficiencies (ICE) up to 87\%. Grass samples presented higher poly-saccharides ({$>$} 70 wmf\%) and extractives (25 wmf\%) contents, leading to lower hard carbon yields, ultra-microporosity formation and the highest CO2 SSA ({$>$} 199 m(2)/g). Most grass samples had high ash contents (6-15 wmf\%), rich in Si and Ca. SiC whiskers were observed over hard carbon surface, responsible for high N-2 SSA (20-97 m(2)/g), and consequently, lower ICE ({$<$} 74\%). Localized graphitic domains were identified originating from Ca and Si catalytic effect for graphitization. Limited turbostratic domains and C purity in these samples induced low reversible capacities ({$<$} 254 mAh/g).},

We demonstrate the methods of operation and performance of a lab scale redox flow battery (RFB), which is assembled from unmodified, commercially available material and cycled with a vanadium electrolyte in order to provide a comparative baseline of expected performance. Common misconceptions about the thermodynamic window for water splitting are addressed and further express the need to develop next-generation aqueous redox flow battery electrolytes. Although non-aqueous electrolytes are a popular approach, they suffer from distinct challenges that limit energy and power density in comparison with aqueous electrolytes. Expanding the scope of aqueous electrolytes to include metal-chelate complexes allows electrolytes to be as tailorable as organic species, while maintaining robust metal-based redox processes. A flow battery assembly and operation guide is provided to help facilitate the use of flow battery testing in the evaluation of next-generation electrolytes.},

Ultrasonic measurements are performed on a commercial mobile phone battery over the full operating voltage window with the lithiation and delithiation of electrodes observed at 36 locations on the surface of the cell. X-ray computed tomography was performed on the cell to ascertain the internal architecture and features that enabled the architecture of the battery to be correlated with the acoustic signature. Analyses of the acoustic signals obtained suggest that the anode and cathode layers can be identified by examining the change in attenuation associated with the charging process. It is also seen that expansions of the electrode layers are inhibited by the presence of the anode current collecting tab in the battery which leads to spatial inhomogeneities in the expansion of the electrode layer examined within the cell.},

By means of cyclic voltammetry, the reduction of two different precursors of grafting species was characterized. The differences observed in the electrochemical signal for both precursors were rationalized through thermodynamics parameters for the reduction reaction calculated by density functional theory (DFT).

The catalysts were heated to 100 °C and subjected to different atmospheres - 5\% H 2 /N 2 , 5\% CO/N 2 , N 2 , air - of interest for fuel cell operation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to follow changes in the catalyst structure, most importantly particle growth, oxidation, and (de-)alloying. Alloying is observed to be advantageous, as it decreases particle growth and oxidation tendency in the catalysts. Initially, all electrocatalysts contained large amounts of the respective oxides, as indicated by pronounced white-line intensities in the XANES spectra, whereas the catalysts were reduced to the metallic state upon exposure to hydrogen. In CO atmosphere, however, ruthenium oxides remain stable, depending on the Pt to Ru site distribution: it is assumed that Pt in contact with Ru acts as a "catalyst" for the reduction of ruthenium oxides and strengthens the Ru-CO bond favouring it over Ru-O (ligand effect). Consequently, the share of ruthenium oxides in the Pt-Ru alloy decreases in 5\% CO/N 2 , whereas for the Pt/Ru mixture and the pure Ru it does not change significantly. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In CO atmosphere, the extent of CO poisoning is less for both bimetallic systems.

  abstract = {Catholyte in all-vanadium redox-flow battery (VRFB) which consists of vanadium salts dissolved in sulphuric acid is known to be stabilized by phosphoric acid to slow down the thermal aging at temperatures higher than 40 °C. To reveal the role of phosphoric acid, the thermally-induced aggregation is investigated using variable-temperature 51V, 31P, 17O, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results indicate that the thermal stabilization of vanadium(V) electrolyte is attained by the involvement of monomeric and dimeric vanadium(V) species in the reaction with phosphoric acid which is concurrent to the formation of neutral hydroxo-aqua vanadium(V) precipitation precursor. The dimers are stabilized by counter ions due to association reaction or if such stabilization is not possible, precipitation of vanadium pentoxide is favored. The evolution of particles size distributions at 50 °C in electrolyte samples containing 1.6 M vanadium and 4.0 M total sulphate and the pathways of precipitate formation are discussed. The optimal total phosphate concentration is found to be of 0.15 M. However, the induction time is assumed to be dependent not only on the total phosphate concentrations, but also on the ratio of total vanadium(V) to sulphate concentrations.},

When applied to the screening of pipelines, it provides 100 percent volumetric coverage of an extended axial length of piping (tens to hundreds of feet depending on pipe configuration) in a relatively short period of time. When properly applied, it has proven to be of great use to pipeline operators wishing to establish the integrity of highly inaccessible sections of their lines. When using GWT, all parties involved should be mindful that it is a screening tool sensitive to changes in cross section area and pipe stiffness. Although most GWT systems are able to provide the user with estimated wall-loss values for indications that have been detected, the need for accurate remaining wall values requires the use of a secondary method (typically conventional UT) to measure the actual remaining wall value at the indication.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The vanadium crossover through the membrane can have a significant impact on the capacity of the vanadium redox flow battery over long-term charge–discharge cycling. The different vanadium ions move unsymmetrically through the membrane and this leads to a build-up of vanadium ions in one-half cell with a corresponding decrease in the other. In this paper, a dynamic model is developed based on different crossover mechanisms (diffusion, migration and convection) for each of the four vanadium ions, water and protons in the electrolytes. With a simple to use approach, basic mass transport theory is used to simulate the transfer of vanadium ions in the battery. The model is validated with own measurements and can therefore predict the battery capacity as a function of time. This is used to analyse the battery performance by applying a continuous overflow from one-half cell to the other. Different overflow rates were analysed with regard to an impact of the performance and electrolyte stability. It was observed that a continuous overflow increases the capacity significantly but that the electrolyte stability plays an essential role using a membrane with a big vanadium crossover. Even with a good performance, a complete remixing of the tanks is necessary to prevent electrolyte precipitations. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

In this study, the area specific membrane resistances of different materials (cation exchange membranes, anion exchange membranes and a porous separator) were measured under conditions relevant for practical vanadium redox flow battery operation by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The transient behavior of the membrane resistance upon current density changes was found to be strongly dependent on the thickness and the internal structure of the tested materials. In most cases, the membrane resistance decreased with increasing current density, while only the FAP-375-PP membrane showed an increasing resistance during discharge. For thin membranes and especially the Celgard® 3401 separator, a higher resistance was determined than expected from thickness and electrolyte conductivity. Regarding the influence of the state of charge on the resistance, only the separator and the FAP-375-PP membrane revealed the behavior expected from the electrolyte conductivity. Overall, our results clearly show that the processes in the membranes contributing to their resistance are highly complex and require further investigations.},

Using this alternative approach, a considerable influence of the structure of the GDL on the electrode morphology could be demonstrated.

The Pt nanoparticles are sized between 3-4 nm and are highly dispersed on the support. Transmission electron micrographs show that the individual Pt nanoparticles are covered by an amorphous coating layer - probably hydrous ruthenium oxide, in good agreement with the XPS data. Electrochemical measurements on model electrodes indicate that proton conductivity of the supporting material is strongly affected by interdiffusion of methanol.

For this purpose, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a valuable and well established tool.

Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis tackles this issue by deconvoluting EIS data with respect to the time constants of the individual processes. It hence circumvents the necessity of finding a suitable equivalent circuit model and thus allows for data evaluation without any a-priori knowledge of the system under study. For the first time, we herein present the application of DRT transform to EIS data of a VRFB. By varying experimental conditions and employing full cell as well as double half cell operational modes, we are able to identify the faradaic process of the negative half cell. This enables us to visualize the negative half cell's contribution to the overall impedance of a VRFB even in a full cell EIS measurement. By an accelerated degradation experiment we finally demonstrate the great potential of DRT analysis for future application in the monitoring of electrode degradation in VRFB.},

  abstract = {Recent scandals in pollutant emissions by combustion engines have once more raised awareness of the relevance of shifting individual mobility to electrically driven vehicles powered by renewable energies. High costs and large quality fluctuations during the production of high-energy batteries are considered to be among the main impediments of electric cars to succeed on the consumer market. In order to reduce costs and improve the quality of lithium-ion batteries, a comprehensive quality management concept is proposed in this paper. Goal is the definition of standards for battery production regardless of cell format, production processes and technology. A well-structured procedure is suggested for identification and handling of fluctuations in the quality of intermediate products, leading to a reduction of scrap rates by detecting deviations in early process stages and, additionally, offering the possibility for process control and feedback. Based on a definition of internal and external requirements for processes and intermediate products, the relevant parameters are derived and requirements for measurement equipment are identified. By establishing internal decision points (quality gates), measurement steps can be aggregated, minimizing effort for quality control and summarizing information on relevant quality parameters of intermediate products. Hence, recommendations for process control and the definition of rejection criterions and classifications for intermediate products are provided.},

  abstract = {The catalytic graphitization procedure was optimized by impregnating polyacrylonitrile-based felts with iron(iii) chloride solution (0.5 wt\% Fe) as the catalyst. By this approach, the graphitization temperature of the felts was reduced to 1000 °C and below. This allowed retaining higher nitrogen contents in the felts, most probably enhancing their electrocatalytic activity for utilization in redox flow batteries. Moreover, lower process temperatures will reduce the production costs of carbon felt (CF) electrodes in the future. Combining the catalytic graphitization with a saltlating step, porous carbon-carbon composite electrodes with a 100 times increased surface area (126 m2 g-1) were obtained. The structure, graphitization degree and porosity were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nitrogen sorption (BET), whereas the electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes for application in all-vanadium redox flow batteries was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV).},

This study investigates the electrode-specific effects of raw and thermally oxidized (PAN and rayon-based) carbon felts on their electrochemical behavior at the negative and the positive electrode in all vanadium redox-flow batteries. By means of steady-state single cell measurements, it is verified that oxidative surface treatment has opposite effects on negative and positive redox couples and that the beneficial influence on the vanadium redox-flow battery performance is mainly brought about by substantially improved charge-transfer kinetics at the negative electrode. Similarly, the type of carbon precursor and the degree of graphitic character have a particular impact on the electrode behavior.},

When the coated membrane was assembled into a large single cell of a vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) with a surface area of 35 cm2, it was found that its cycling performance was greatly enhanced at much higher current densities than was afforded by the pristine Nafion membrane. A masking technique was also applied during the electrospraying process to create alternating domains of coated and uncoated membrane surfaces, which helped to mitigate the restriction of proton transport through the membrane due to the coating, while still decreasing the surface resistivity and thus the interfacial resistance of the membrane. Our results reveal that a very small mass of CNTs (â0.015 mg CNT/cm2) enabled large improvements in the capacity retention and voltaic efficiencies of the vanadium redox battery during charging and discharging. This method has shown to be a reasonably fast, simple, and scalable technique for improving rate capability of VRBs, with the potential for extension to other redox flow battery systems.},

  abstract = {Responding to rapid growth of the renewable energy applications, it is crucial to develop low cost and high efficient large-scale energy storage systems in order to smooth out the intermittency of the renewable energy resources. As one of the most promising large-scale energy storage systems, vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) has attracted great attention in recent times. Membrane is one of the key components of VRFB which not only affects the whole cyclability performance but also determines the economic viability of the system. The membrane separates the positive and negative half-cells and prevents the cross-mixing of vanadium ions while providing required ionic conductivity. The ideal membrane should have good ionic exchange capacity; high ionic conductivity, low water uptake, swelling ratio, area electrical resistance and vanadium and other poly-halide ions permeability; and good chemical stability, as well as low cost. Numerous efforts have been spent on the development of different types of membranes, including different functional groups ion exchange membrane and non-ionic porous membrane. This paper reviews the research on membranes in VRFB system, including the properties, development of traditional commercial membranes as well as recently developed membranes. It explores various methods of fabrication of the membrane products which have received relatively little attention. A detailed summary table of the new membranes with their properties, fabrication and costs is provided to serve as a reference guide for researchers and industrialists interested in VRFB system building and dynamic modelling set. Subsequently, the challenges and future directions of membrane research are examined.},

  abstract = {A sulfur‐rich copolymer is synthesized via a sustainable, eco‐friendly approach using two major wastes namely, elemental sulfur (industrial waste) and cardanol (agro waste) and its application as cathode active material in Li−S battery. The presence of chemically bound sulfur (90 wt\%) utilising cardanol (10 wt\%) derivative in the copolymer (S90) showed a reduction in the active material dissolution into the electrolyte. In addition, the organic sulfur units get dispersed into the insoluble/insulating Li2S2/Li2S phase and thus found to suppress their irreversible deposition. Li−S battery based on S90/multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) (10 wt\%) exhibited a reversible capacity of 1302 mAh g−1 at 2nd cycle, maintaining a high reversible capacity of 928 mAh g−1 after 70 cycles at a relatively constant coulombic efficiency over 99 \% at current rate of 200 mA g−1. At 1000 mA g−1 current rate, the composite cathode delivered a reversible capacity of 697 mAh g−1 at 2nd cycle and retained 75 \% of its initial capacity even after 180 cycles.},

  abstract = {The vanadium redox flow battery pioneered by Skyllas-Kazacos et al. at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) is currently considered as one of the few electrochemical energy storage systems suitable for use in the large-scale utility applications that are emerging in response to the increasing global implementation of renewable energy technologies for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. While the original all-vanadium redox flow battery (G1 VRF) has already been successfully implemented in a wide range of stationary field trials in Japan, U.S.A., Austria, Italy and Australia, further cost reduction has been needed for its widespread market up-take. In this paper, up to 80\% efficiency is reported for the latest 5–10 kW G1 VRF battery stack employing low-cost stack materials that are expected to achieve the necessary cost structure for the majority of stationary energy storage applications. While the G1 VRF battery has shown high efficiencies and excellent cycle life, however, its low energy density has restricted its use in mobile applications. The new Generation 2 vanadium bromide redox battery (G2 V/Br) patented by UNSW in 2001 has been shown to potentially double the energy density of the G1 VRF battery, allowing mobile applications to be considered. In this paper, the performance of the G2 V/Br is presented at a range of temperatures and the use of complexing agents is shown to successfully bind any bromine produced during charging to prevent the formation of bromine vapours.

  abstract = {The electrolyte is one of the most important components of the vanadium redox flow battery and its properties will affect cell performance and behavior in addition to the overall battery cost. Vanadium exists in several oxidation states with significantly different half-cell potentials that can produce practical cell voltages. It is thus possible to use the same element in both half-cells and thereby eliminate problems of cross-contamination inherent in all other flow battery chemistries. Electrolyte properties vary with supporting electrolyte composition, state-of-charge, and temperature and this will impact on the characteristics, behavior, and performance of the vanadium battery in practical applications. This Review provides a broad overview of the physical properties and characteristics of the vanadium battery electrolyte under different conditions, together with a description of some of the processing methods that have been developed to produce vanadium electrolytes for vanadium redox flow battery applications.[on SciFinder (R)]},

To separate the contributions of anode and cathode to the full-cell impedance, a reference electrode is required. However, if the reference electrode is placed inappropriately, the impedance response can easily be biased and lead to erroneous conclusions. In this study, we present a novel micro-reference electrode for Swagelok-type T-cells which is suitable for long-term impedance and reference potential measurements. The reference electrode consists of a thin insulated gold wire, which is placed centrally between cathode and anode and is in-situ electrochemically alloyed with lithium. The resulting lithium-gold alloy reference electrode shows remarkable stability ({$>$}500 h) even during cycling or at elevated temperatures (40 • C). The accuracy of impedance measurements with this novel reference electrode is carefully validated. Further, we investigate the effect of different vinylene carbonate (VC) contents in the electrolyte on the charge transfer resistance of LFP/graphite full cells and demonstrate that the ratio of VC to active material, rather than the VC concentration, determines the impedance of the anode SEI.},

The SEI-film formation properties of both graphite materials were correlated with their active surface area (ASA), being responsible for the interactions between the carbon and the electrolyte system. The active surface area was determined from the amount of CO and CO2 gas desorbed at temperatures up to 950 °C from the graphite material surface after chemisorption of oxygen at 300 °C. The structural ordering at the graphite surface increased significantly during the heat treatment of the SLX50 graphite material as indicated by the significant decrease of the ASA value. The increased surface crystallinity was confirmed by krypton gas adsorption, Raman spectroscopy as well as temperature-programmed desorption. This increased structural ordering seemed to be the parameter being responsible for a hindered passivation of the heat-treated SLX50 causing partial exfoliation of the graphite structure during the first electrochemical lithium insertion in the ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte. In the case of the ethylene carbonate/1-fluoro ethylene carbonate electrolyte system, primarily the fluoro compound is responsible for the graphite passivation. In this electrolyte system, pristine SLX50 and the less reactive, heat-treated SLX50 graphite showed significantly different SEI-film formation mechanisms. In contrast, no difference in the passivation mechanism could be identified for different graphite surfaces in the ethylene carbonate electrolyte system with propylene carbonate as co-solvent. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Electrode processing based on the state-of-the-art materials represents a scientific opportunity toward a cost-effective measure for improving the lithium-ion battery performance. In this regard, perhaps the most important is the drying step in a typical non-aqueous based slurry processing which can profoundly impact the electrode microstructure and hence performance. Solvent evaporation during drying plays a critical role in the redistribution of the particulate phases consisting of active particle, conductive additive and binder. In this work, we attempt to provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of solvent evaporation on the electrode characteristics and performance via a combined experimental and theoretical analysis. This study elucidates that a non-uniform distribution of the constituent phases, especially the relatively mobile conductive additive and binder, can develop which depends on the solvent evaporation, particle diffusion and sedimentation attributes. Experimental results and theoretical analysis reveal the impact of evaporation rate on the conductive additive and binder distribution in the electrode microstructure and resulting electrochemical performance. Our analysis has shown that a slower two-stage drying, as opposed to a high-rate single-stage drying, allows for a favorable distribution of binder and conductive additive, thus reducing internal cell resistance and improving electrochemical performance.},

  abstract = {Biomass is a promising precursor for producing high-performance hard carbon as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of its high low-voltage plateau capacity. However, the effect of residual ash in biomass on the electrochemical performance of hard carbons has rarely been investigated. This work describes an effective ash-removal approach as a critical step for preparing high-performance anodes for SIBs. A strong correlation between the ash removal techniques with structural and electrochemical properties of hard carbon was revealed. By examining various ash-removal techniques prior to carbonization and after carbonization using aqueous acid, neutral, and alkaline solutions, it was demonstrated that the removal of ash from raw cocoa pod husk (CPH) using aqueous acid and subsequent carbonization at 1300 degrees C can produce hard carbon with high Na+ ion uptake in the low-voltage plateau region. During the acid pretreatment, ash and some hemicellulose fractions were removed, and carbonization of the acid-treated CPH resulted in hard carbon with a high degree of graphitization and reduced surface area. When tested as an anode in SIBs, the hard carbon produced from the acid-treated CPH exhibited an exceptionally high capacity of 317 mAh g(-1) and high plateau capacity of 244 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 A g(-1), with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 87\%. At a high current density of 250 mA g(-1), a high capacity of 134 mAh g(-1) was maintained after 800 cycles. Post-treatment of hard carbon did not enhance the electrochemical performance. The physicochemical and electrochemical properties of hard carbons produced with the various pre- and post-treatment techniques were presented.

We show that the overall drying energy can be reduced by at least 50\% by using a multi-zone drying process. Also, the peak solvent flux can be reduced by at least 40\%. We further present the effect of using an aqueous solvent instead of N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) in electrode drying.

Therefore, it is urgent to develop the higher performance secondary batteries. Their lifetime and stability are found to be strongly dependent on the nature of passivation film called solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film formed on the anode surface in the initial charge-discharge cycle. However, since it is difficult to directly observe the film formation processes in experiment, its microscopic mechanism is still not found. On the other hand, although the theoretical methods are useful complement to the experiment, some new methodologies are necessary to understand the long-term processes of SEI film, which is produced as a result of that a lot of chemical reactions proceed simultaneously. Under the circumstances, we have developed Red Moon method that can simulate such complex chemical reaction systems, and were able to analyze for the first time the SEI film formation processes on the anode surface at the atomistic level. Then, we clarified theoretically the microscopic mechanism of the additive effect which is essential to improve the Na-ion battery performance so as to enhance the SEI film formation. This new microscopic insight must provide an important guiding principle for use in designing the most suitable electrolytes for developing high-performance secondary batteries.},

  abstract = {Increasing energy demands have expedited the need for grid-scale energy storage solutions. High power densities have been achieved using carbon-based electrodes in all-vanadium redox flow batteries. However, fundamental limitations must be overcome to improve viability. This study addresses the infiltration of vanadium solutions into dry electrodes using time-resolved 3D X-ray tomography, thus relating the rate of permeation and other wetting phenomena to microstructural characteristics and surface properties of carbon fibers. It is shown that electrolyte infiltration proceeds according to a non-uniform progression front, with small channel-like pores filled in first and remaining larger pores filled only after 6 h. The vanadium concentration affects the infiltration rate, being faster for 0.5 M VOSO4 while slower for both higher and lower concentrations. The infiltration mechanism is strongly correlated with the temporal decrease in the contact angle, revealing that fibers become more hydrophilic as they are treated by the electrolyte solution. Modification of carbon surface groups through plasma treatment boosts the infiltration process. The results reveal counter-intuitive behaviors of the electrolyte flow whereby the capillary driven flow is found to be secondary to the primary wetting mechanisms. Uncovering these physical phenomena is essential for operational procedures in flow batteries and avoiding cell degradation.},

The morphology of mixtures of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO) copolymers and lithium polysulfides were studied using a combination of X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. This study is motivated by the possibility of using block copolymers as electrolytes in lithium–sulfur cells. The phase behavior of SEO/Li2Sx mixtures were found to differ fundamentally from mixtures of SEO and other lithium salts. The morphology of certain SEO/Li2Sx mixtures obtained below the melting temperature of the poly(ethylene oxide) block has not been previously observed in block copolymer/salt mixtures.},

In this study, a crosslinked polymer composite solid electrolyte was presented, which enabled the construction of lithium batteries with outstanding electrochemical behavior over long-term cycling. The crosslinked polymeric host was synthesized through polymerization of the terminal amines of O,O-bis(2-aminopropyl) polypropylene glycol-block-polyethylene glycol-block-polypropylene glycol and terminal epoxy groups of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether at 90 °C and provided an amorphous matrix for Li+ dissolution. This composite solid electrolyte containing Li+ salt and garnet filler exhibited high flexibility, which supported the formation of favorable interfaces with the active materials, and possessed enough mechanical strength to suppress the penetration of lithium dendrites. Ionic conductivities higher than 5.0×10−4 S cm−1 above 45 °C were obtained as well as a wide electrochemical stability window ({$>$}4.51 V vs. Li/Li+) and a high Li+ diffusion coefficient (≈16.6×10−13 m2 s−1).

This new fabrication method allows precise control of ionic and electronic conduction pathways as well as the interfaces between the different electrode components, thus enabling new strategies for tailored electrode designs. Further, it is shown that the polyelectrolytes used to build up the electrode by electrostatic self-assembly can be converted into a conductive matrix by a simple carbonization step. This leads to a firmly adhering carbon film on the surface of LiFePO4, which further improves electron transport. The three-dimensional composite cathode exhibits a high specific capacity even at high current rates as well as a long cycle life.

  abstract = {A novel four-step strategy for real-space simulation of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at carbon felt electrodes is presented, circumventing the diffusion domain approximation approach used so far for CV simulation at porous electrodes. At first, the three-dimensional template of the internal electrode structure is constructed from micro X-ray tomography measurements. Subsequently, by exploiting the Douglas–Gunn modification of the three-dimensional Crank–Nicolson algorithm to Cottrellian boundary conditions, the mass transfer controlled current of this ”true” network is obtained. Based on this current, the third step is to compute the mass transfer functions related to the electrode under investigation by an inverse convolution algorithm. In this manner, the spatial dimensionality of the system is reduced from three to one, resulting in significant savings in computation time. The fourth and final step is then to simulate CV experiments via classical convolution methods, featuring the great advantage that any degree of electrochemical reversibility, coupled homogeneous reactions, electrolyte resistances and double layer capacities can be inplemented readily. As a proof of concept, the simulations are supported by experimental data acquired for the oxidation of VO2+ in carbon felt electrodes.},

Carbon based electrode materials are derived from standard Vulcan XC-72 carbon, treated by chemical surface etching techniques proposed for carbon felt-electrodes in the literature. Additional electrochemical characterization is performed using stationary cyclic voltammetry (CV) followed by fitting of CV data, Fourier-transform alternating-current cyclic voltammetry (FT-ACCV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) followed by distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis. To our knowledge the present paper is the first study using the RRDE technique for separating HER and V3+-reduction reactions. It is demonstrated that the ratio of HER to V3+-reduction significantly depends on the chemical pretreatment of the carbon electrodes and that the V3+-reduction proceeds at an optimum rate at E − ERHE = −0.45 V. Separating the HER from the V3+-reduction also allows us to provide highly accurate values for the diffusion coefficient of the V3+-ion in sulfuric acid solutions.},

In this context we present an algorithm based on the use of a modified Talbot contour for inverse Laplace transformation, providing the mass transfer functions required for the calculation of the CV responses in external cylindrical finite diffusion space. First-order homogenous chemical kinetics preceding and/or following the electrochemical reactions are implemented in this algorithm as well. The VO2+ oxidation is investigated as model reaction at pristine and electrochemically aged commercial carbon felt electrodes. A fit of simulated data to experimental data clearly shows that an electrochemical aging predominantly affects the kinetics of the electron transfer reaction and that internal electrode surfaces and pore size distributions remain constant. The estimated pore size distributions are in excellent agreement with porosimetry measurements, validating our theory and providing a new strategy to determine electrode porosities and electrode kinetics simultaneously via CV.},

  abstract = {Carbon has unique characteristics that make it an ideal material for use in a wide variety of electrochemical applications ranging from metal refining to electrocatalysis and fuel cells. In polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), carbon is used as a gas diffusion layer, electrocatalyst support and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. When used as electrocatalyst support, amorphous carbonaceous materials suffer from enhanced oxidation rates at high potentials over time. This drawback has prompted an extensive effort to improve the properties of amorphous carbon and to identify alternate carbon-based materials to replace carbon blacks. Alternate support materials are classified in carbon nanotubes and fibers, mesoporous carbon, multi-layer graphene (undoped and doped with metal nanoparticles) and reduced graphene oxide. A comparative review of all these supports is provided. Work on catalytically active carbon hybrids is focused on the development of non-precious metal electrocatalysts that will significantly reduce the cost without sacrificing catalytic activity. Of the newer electrocatalysts, nitrogen/metal-functionalized carbons and composites are emerging as possible contenders for commercial PEFCs. Nitrogen-doped carbon hybrids with transition metals and their polymer composites exhibit high ORR activity and selectivity and these catalytic properties are presented in detail in this review. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It provides a sufficient condition under which both OMP and Donobo's basis pursuit (BP) paradigm can recover the optimal representation of an exactly sparse signal. It leverages this theory to show that both OMP and BP succeed for every sparse input signal from a wide class of dictionaries. These quasi-incoherent dictionaries offer a natural generalization of incoherent dictionaries, and the cumulative coherence function is introduced to quantify the level of incoherence. This analysis unifies all the recent results on BP and extends them to OMP. Furthermore, the paper develops a sufficient condition under which OMP can identify atoms from an optimal approximation of a nonsparse signal. From there, it argues that OMP is an approximation algorithm for the sparse problem over a quasi-incoherent dictionary. That is, for every input signal, OMP calculates a sparse approximant whose error is only a small factor worse than the minimal error that can be attained with the same number of terms. © 2004 IEEE.},

Each grafting method results in a different loading of the surface organic layer, which is quantified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Grafted graphite powders exhibit controlled solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) morphology, Li-ion intercalation, and averted exfoliation. Grafted graphite powders were further modified by transformation of the terminal functional group of the grafted surface layer by chemical or electrochemical treatments. This step tunes the reactivity of grafted material towards non-aqueous electrolyte, which is reflected in modified electrochemical properties like formation of SEI, overall Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation kinetics, cyclability, practical specific charge, and eventual exfoliation of graphite. The morphology of the grafted samples is retained after electrochemical cycling as well as after functional group transformation steps. The morphology of the SEI is also seen to be similar to that of the grafted layer in all the cases.

Fabricating artificial SEI layer can be one promising approach to solve the above issues.

Moreover, the reaction mechanism of artificial SEIs was briefly analyzed, and the research prospect was also discussed.},

Thermal stability tests showed that chitosan (CTS) and nonionic-type polyacrylamide (NPAM) additives with -NH2; ammonium thiocyanate (ATC), ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) and ammonium ferric sulfate (AFS) additives with -NH4+ could significantly improve the thermal stability of the V(V) electrolyte over a wide temperature range of - 5 °C to 45 °C. The electrochemical behavior of the V(V) electrolyte with these preferred additives was further studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), steady state polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charge-discharge test. The results indicated that the electrochemical activity and reversibility for the V(V) electrolyte with the best additive CTS with -NH4+ was significantly improved compared with the additives with -NH2 and pristine one. In addition, the VRB employing the positive electrolyte with CTS exhibited excellent cycling stability and charge-discharge behavior with a high energy efficiency of 82.5\%. The N-containing and O-containing functional groups of CTS in the V(V) electrolyte could modify the electrode and further improve the electrochemical performance and cycling stability of VRB.},

  abstract = {A passivation layer called the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is formed on electrode surfaces from decomposition products of electrolytes. The SEI allows Li+ transport and blocks electrons in order to prevent further electrolyte decomposition and ensure continued electrochemical reactions. The formation and growth mechanism of the nanometer thick SEI films are yet to be completely understood owing to their complex structure and lack of reliable in situ experimental techniques. Significant advances in computational methods have made it possible to predictively model the fundamentals of SEI. This review aims to give an overview of state-of-the-art modeling progress in the investigation of SEI films on the anodes, ranging from electronic structure calculations to mesoscale modeling, covering the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrolyte reduction reactions, SEI formation, modification through electrolyte design, correlation of SEI properties with battery performance, and the artificial SEI design. Multi-scale simulations have been summarized and compared with each other as well as with experiments. Computational details of the fundamental properties of SEI, such as electron tunneling, Li-ion transport, chemical/mechanical stability of the bulk SEI and electrode/(SEI/) electrolyte interfaces have been discussed. This review shows the potential of computational approaches in the deconvolution of SEI properties and design of artificial SEI. We believe that computational modeling can be integrated with experiments to complement each other and lead to a better understanding of the complex SEI for the development of a highly efficient battery in the future.},

Specifically, structural evolution and properties of PFA during carbonization, and fabrication of nanoporous carbons through nanocasting process, are introduced.

In cyclic voltammetry measurements, we find initial activation of the reductive electrolyte decomposition at faster scan rates (1 or 10 mV s−1), whereas this is not the case at a slower scan rate (0.1 mV s−1). This activation effect, which is more pronounced for DMC, is explained by an increase in the HOPG surface area, presumably by electrode exfoliation; it is not observed on surface-defect-rich samples. XPS analysis shows that, regardless of the solvent and the scan rate, the SEI is mainly composed of LiF and only small amounts of solvent and other salt decomposition products.},

The total electrochemical activity toward vanadium redox reaction increases greatly with the decrease of the particle sizes for GP, which mainly attributes to the increasing surface area and exposed edge plane sites.

Benefiting from their branched molecular architecture, SIVHPs presented excellent solubility in polar organic solvents with an ultrahigh concentration of 400 mg mL −1 . After end-capping by sequential click chemistry of thiol–ene and Menschutkin quaternization reactions, we obtained water soluble SIVHPs for the first time. The sulfur-rich SIVHPs were employed as solution processible cathode-active materials for Li–S batteries, by facile fluid infiltration into conductive frameworks of graphene-based ultralight aerogels (GUAs). The SIVHPs-based cells showed high initial specific capacities of 1247.6 mA h g −1 with 400 charge–discharge cycles. The cells also demonstrated an excellent rate capability and a considerable depression of shuttle effect with stable coulombic efficiency of around 100\%. The electrochemical performance of SIVHP in Li–S batteries overwhelmed the case of neat sulfur, due to the chemical fixation of sulfur. The combination of high solubility, structure flexibility, and superior electrochemical performance opens a door for the promising application of SIVHPs.}

Zwei entscheidende Bestandteile der VRFB sind die Elektroden und die Ionenaustauschermembran. Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Charakterisierung und Modifizierung geeigneter Elektroden- und Membranmaterialien. Neun unterschiedliche Ionenaustauschermembranen wurden hinsichtlich ihres Flächenwiderstandes, ihrer Vanadium- und Wasserdurchlässigkeit, ihres Selbstentladungsverhaltens in der Einzelzelle und ihrer Performance in Lade-/Entladetests untersucht. Mit Hilfe der Untersuchungsergebnisse lässt sich gezielt eine passende Membran für den Einsatz in der VRFB wählen. Weiterhin konnten durch die Modifikation der F-9120-Membran mit Polypyrrol ihre Eigenschaften verbessert werden. Als Elektrodenmaterial wurden Graphitfilze verwendet. Unbehandelte Graphitfilze weisen jedoch hohe Überspannungen gegenüber den Reaktionen in der VRFB auf, sodass Modifizierungen notwendig sind. Es wurden drei Modifizierungsprinzipien angewendet: Bildung von Ober- flächensauerstoffgruppen, Oberflächenvergrößerung und Stickstoffdotierung. Die elektrochemische Charakterisierung erfolgte durch Cyclovoltammetrie, elektrochemische Impedanzspektroskopie, Strom-Spannungskennlinien und Lade-/Entladezyklen.},

It is found that the sediment at positive electrodes is V 2O5·1.6H2O, and the sediment at negative electrodes is V2(SO4)3·10H 2O. Although impurities influence the stability of vanadium electrolyte to some extent, the matching relationship between the vanadium and H2SO4 concentration is more important for improving the electrolyte stability. Precipitation of V(V) ions from solution can be prevented effectively by increasing the concentration of H2SO4. While, too concentrated H2SO4 would favor the precipitation of V(III) ions from negative electrolytes. To avoid the sensitivity of vanadium electrolyte to impurities and concern about both the stability of positive and negative electrolytes, the concentration of H 2SO4 should be raised to a certain extent to confirm the stability of positive electrolyte. At the same time, a moderate vanadium concentration should be employed to assure the stability of negative electrolytes. From the viewpoint of increasing the stability, the preferred vanadium electrolyte composition is 1.5-1.6 M vanadium in 4-5 M H 2SO4 medium at temperature above -10 °C. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Contaminant hydrogeological processes occurring in porous media are typically not amenable to direct observation. As a result, indirect measurements (e.g., contaminant breakthrough at a fixed location) are often used to infer processes occurring at different scales, locations, or times. To overcome this limitation, non-invasive imaging methods are increasingly being used in contaminant hydrogeology research. Four of the most common methods, and the subjects of this review, are optical imaging using UV or visible light, dual-energy gamma radiation, X-ray microtomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Non-invasive imaging techniques have provided valuable insights into a variety of complex systems and processes, including porous media characterization, multiphase fluid distribution, fluid flow, solute transport and mixing, colloidal transport and deposition, and reactions. In this paper we review the theory underlying these methods, applications of these methods to contaminant hydrogeology research, and methods' advantages and disadvantages. As expected, there is no perfect method or tool for non-invasive imaging. However, optical methods generally present the least expensive and easiest options for imaging fluid distribution, solute and fluid flow, colloid transport, and reactions in artificial two-dimensional (2D) porous media. Gamma radiation methods present the best opportunity for characterization of fluid distributions in 2D at the Darcy scale. X-ray methods present the highest resolution and flexibility for three-dimensional (3D) natural porous media characterization, and 3D characterization of fluid distributions in natural porous media. And MRI presents the best option for 3D characterization of fluid distribution, fluid flow, colloid transport, and reaction in artificial porous media. Obvious deficiencies ripe for method development are the ability to image transient processes such as fluid flow and colloid transport in natural porous media in three dimensions, the ability to image many reactions of environmental interest in artificial and natural porous media, and the ability to image selected processes over a range of scales in artificial and natural porous media. © 2010.},

  abstract = {Among others, the performance of lithium-ion batteries is determined by the structure and material distribution of the electrodes. These electrodes are known to develop an inhomogeneous inactive material distribution during drying of the wet-coated film. The segregation of the conductive additive and the binder was found for the graphite anodes studied in this work and was proven by indirect and direct analyses. Segregation reduces the adhesion strength between coating and substrate and increases the electrical resistance as well as the elasticity of the anode. It was found by spectroscopic analysis that binder concentration and by association carbon black concentration increase from bottom to top of the coating. This Segregation increases with drying temperature and the amount of solvent that needs to evaporate. An auxiliary parameter is introduced to determine a combined, critical value for the driving force of the solvent evaporation (drying temperature) and the anodes’ mass loading. Finally, the mass loading and/or the drying temperature to avoid segregation can be estimated with regard to the final product and the existing drying equipment.},

  abstract = {Optical fluorescence microscopy is shown to enable both high spatial and temporal resolution of redox-dependent fluorescence in flowing electrolytes. We report the use of fluorescence microscopy coupled with electrochemistry to directly observe the reaction and transport of redox-active quinones within porous carbon electrodes in operando. We observe surprising electrolyte channeling features within several porous electrodes, leading to spatially distinguishable advection-dominated and diffusion-dominated regions. These results challenge the common assumption that transport in porous electrodes can be approximated by a homogeneous Darcy-like permeability, particularly at the length scales relevant to many electrochemical systems such as redox flow batteries. This work presents a new platform to provide highly resolved spatial and temporal insight into electrolyte reactions and transport behavior within porous electrodes.},

In this report, a reliable device is proposed for the electrochemical characterization of electrode materials, and the parameter selection was demonstrated to be critical for achieving reliable evaluation and reducing the effects of side reactions. As for the structure of the graphite felt electrode, volume current density is proposed to replace the area current density as the main evaluation indicator. Furthermore, the effect of side reactions is discussed and the upper limit voltage of 1.60 V is found to be suitable in the charge process of VFB since selecting this value can greatly protect the active sites on the electrode and avoid the capacity fading caused by side reactions.},

Up to date, over 500 papers have been published on various aspects of SERS from electrochemical systems. We then highlight important features of electrochemical SERS (EC-SERS). There are two distinctively different properties of electric fields, the electromagnetic field and static electrochemical field, co-existing in electrochemical systems with various nanostructures. Both chemical and physical enhancements can be influenced to some extent by applying an electrode potential, which makes EC-SERS one of the most complicated systems in SERS. Great efforts have been made to comprehensively understand SERS and analyze EC-SERS spectra on the basis of the chemical and physical enhancement mechanisms in order to provide meaningful information for revealing the mechanisms of electrochemical adsorption and reaction. The EC-SERS experiments and applications are then discussed from preparation of nanostructured electrodes to investigation of SERS mechanisms and from characterization of adsorption configuration to elucidation of electrochemical reaction mechanisms.

  abstract = {Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have drawn much attention as energy storage systems for large-scale grid applications due to their high energy density and low cost. As one of the most promising anode materials in PIBs, hard carbon (HC) has been prepared from various sources but exhibited varying electrochemical performance, probably due to a limited understanding of materials structure and K-ion storage mechanisms. Especially, biomass (such as lignin) represents an abundant source for synthesizing HC. However, few studies have investigated the role of lignin molecular weight (MW) in determining HC's structure and eventually ion storage mechanism. Herein, we developed a series of HCs from lignin with different MWs at serial pyrolysis temperatures and correlated the lignin MWs and pyrolysis temperatures with HC's structure, electrochemical performance, and K-ion storage mechanisms. The best lignin-derived HC delivered a high reversible specific capacity of -300 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1). Moreover, a binary K-ion storage mechanism of "bulk insertion + surface adsorption" was fortified in lignin-derived HCs, and the contributions of each storage behavior were quantified via kinetics calculations for the first time. It was found that lignin with medium MW (9660 g mol(-1)) pyrolyzed at medium temperatures (700 degrees C) yielded HC with an optimal mixture of graphite-like nanocrystals with the largest interlayer distance and amorphous structure to maximize K-ion storage from both bulk-insertion and surfaceadsorption mechanisms. This work also established a good example of building a circular economy by turning lignin recycled from wood waste into high value-added carbon products in battery technology.},

Hard carbon (HC) is one of the most popular anodes for practical PIBs due to its high K-ion storage and relatively low material cost. However, the role of electrolytes in determining the HC performance and K-ion storage mechanism has been rarely investigated. Herein, we systematically studied the influence of four electrolyte systems, i.e., two K salts (i.e., KPF6 and KFSI) in carbonate ester and ether solvents, on the K-ion mobility, cycling stability, and charge transfer kinetics of the HC anode in PIBs. It is found that HC anode achieved the best cycling stability and kinetics performance in the KFSI EC/DEC electrolyte. Mechanismic study disclosed that the improved performance could be ascribed to the formation of robust KF-rich SEI resulting from FSI- decomposition, which effectively prevented irreversible side reactions and severe structural decay (e.g., exfoliation and pulverization). The degradation mechanisms of other electrolyte systems are also explained from the viewpoints of SEI formation and solvation/desolvation effect. It is expected that this work will provide guidance on the anode and electrolyte selection and design for PIBs in the near future.},

Electricity-driven synthesis offers a reemerging approach to facilitate the design of reaction sequences toward increased molecular complexity. In addition to the desirable sustainability features of electroorganic processes, the inherent interfacial nature of electrochemical systems present unique opportunities to tune reaction selectivity. To illustrate this feature, we outline examples of mechanism-guided interfacial control over CO2 electroreduction selectivity; a well-studied and instructive electrochemical process with multiple reduction products that are thermodynamically accessible. These studies reveal how controlled proton delivery to the electrode surface and substrate electrosorption with the electrode dictate reaction selectivity. We describe and compare simple, yet salient, examples from the electroorganic literature, where we postulate that similar effects predominate the observed reactivity. This perspective highlights how the interface serves as a tunable dimension in electrochemical processes and delineates unique tools to study, manipulate, and achieve reaction selectivity in electricity-driven organic synthesis.},

The maximum power-based efficiency occurs at different flow rates for the both batteries with and without flow fields. It is found that the battery with flow fields Exhibits 5\% higher energy efficiency than the battery without flow fields, when operating at the flow rates corresponding to each battery's maximum power-based efficiency.

  abstract = {© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. This paper presents topology optimization for the design of flow fields in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are large-scale storage systems for renewable energy resources such as solar and wind power. It is widely known that, in recent VRFB systems, one of the key factors in boosting charging or discharging efficiency is the design of the flow field around carbon fiber electrodes and in flow channels. In this study, topology optimization is applied in order to achieve optimized flow field designs. The optimization problem is formulated as a maximization problem for the generation rate of the vanadium species governed by a simplified electrochemical reaction model. A typical porous model is incorporated into the optimization problem for expressing the carbon fiber electrode; furthermore, a mass transfer coefficient that depends on local velocity is introduced. We investigate the dependencies of the optimized configuration with respect to the porosity of the porous electrode and the pressure loss. Results indicate that patterns of interdigitated flow fields are valid designs for VRFBs.},

  abstract = {Hard carbon draws great interests as anode material in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity, high rate capability and abundance of its precursors. Herein we firstly synthesize the lignin-melamine resins by grafting melamine onto lignin. Afterwards, nitrogen doped hard carbon is prepared by the pyrolysis of lignin-melamine resins with the aid of catalyst (Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O) at 1000 degrees C. Compared with the samples without nitrogen-doping and catalysis, as-prepared nitrogen doped hard carbon exhibits higher reversible capacity (345 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), higher rate capability (145 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability. The superior electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping, graphitic structure and amorphous structure. Among them, nitrogen doping could create the vacancies around the nitrogen sites, which enhance the reactivity and the electronic conductivity of materials. Additionally, graphitic structure also enhances the electronic conductivity of materials, thus improving the electrochemical performance of hard carbon. It is worthwhile that lignin, renewable and abundant biopolymer, is converted to hard carbon with good electrochemical performance, which realizes the high value utilization of lignin.

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play an important role in modern society. The low capacity of graphite cannot meet the demands of LIBs calling for high power and energy densities. Silicon (Si) is one of the most promising materials instead of graphite, because of its high theoretical capacity, low discharge voltage, low cost, etc. However, Si shows low conductivity of both ions and electrons and exhibits a severe volume change during cycles. Fabricating nano-sized Si and Si-based composites is an effective method to enhance the electrochemical performance of LIB anodes. Using a small size of Si nanoparticles (SiNPs) is likely to avoid the cracking of this material. One critical issue is to disclose different types and electrochemical effects of various coupled materials in the Si-based composites for anode fabrication and optimization. Hence, this paper reviews diverse SiNP-based composites for advanced LIBs from the perspective of composition and electrochemical effects. Almost all kinds of materials that have been coupled with SiNPs for LIB applications are summarized, along with their electrochemical influences on the composites. The integrated materials, including carbon materials, metals, metal oxides, polymers, Si-based materials, transition metal nitrides, carbides, dichalcogenides, alloys, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are comprehensively presented.},

  abstract = {Li–S batteries, offering high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1, low cost and nontoxicity, are considered as a fascinating next-generation electric energy storage devices. However, the dissolution of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), shuttle effect and safety issues of Li anode notoriously pose great challenges for the commercialization of Li–S batteries. These problems derive from the interfacial issues among cathodes, separators, electrolytes and anodes, which in turn can be resolved by rational interface tailoring. This review mainly focuses on these interfacial issues in Li–S batteries with traditional liquid electrolytes and the latest research trend including gel polymer electrolytes, solid polymer electrolytes, solid inorganic electrolytes and hybrid electrolytes. In the liquid electrolyte systems, sulfur cathodes can effectively avoid severe shuttle effects and maintain stable cycling with the interfacial regulations of coatings, freestanding interlayers and separator modifications, while Li anode can be modified by protective layers, functional additives, three-dimensional current collectors and Li alloys. In quasi-solid systems (gel polymer electrolytes and hybrid electrolytes), rational designs are applied considering the utility of active materials, restraining LiPSs and suppressing Li dendrites. In all solid-state electrolyte systems (solid polymer electrolytes and solid inorganic electrolytes), the emphasis is to enhance the ionic conductivities and reduce the interfacial resistances. Mechanisms underlying these interfacial issues and corresponding electrochemical performances are discussed. Recent developments on the interfacial designs of Li–S batteries are summarized and highlighted. Based on the most critical factors of the interfaces proposed, prospectives are presented to pave the avenue for the designs of Li–S batteries.},

RFBs typically use metal ions as reacting species. The most exploited types are all-vanadium RFBs (VRFBs). Here, we discuss the core components for the VRFBs, including the development and application of different types of membranes, electrode materials, and stack system. In addition, we introduce the recent progress in the discovery of novel electrolytes, such as redox-active organic compounds, polymers, and organic/inorganic suspensions. Versatile structures, tunable properties, and abundant resources of organic-based electrolytes make them suitable for cost-effective stationary applications.

  abstract = {Surface elemental compositions of model latex clay coatings on an impervious substrate consolidated under various conditions were measured using the XPS technique, in order to clarify when and how colloidal latex particles migrate to the surface during drying. Under similar drying conditions, surface carbon content decreased with the addition of a water-soluble polymer to the coating colors, while remaining virtually unchanged for coatings of different coat weights made with a given color, indicating that surface carbon content variation is mainly caused by migration of latex rather than of water-soluble polymer. The results also showed that for coatings made with a given suspension, surface carbon content decreased with increasing delay time between coating and heating. For coatings frozen during consolidation and dried by sublimation, surface carbon content increased with increasing drying time before freezing. These results suggest that for the model coatings studied, latex migration mainly occurs after coating application before capillary formation during the initial drying stage when coatings are in the liquid phase, contradicting both the conventional capillary transport and boundary wall migration mechanisms. An alternative mechanism which attributes latex migration to surface trapping effect and to higher Brownian mobility of the smaller latex particles compared with pigment appears to provide a systematically consistent explanation to those phenomena. The new particle migration mechanism implies that segregation of colloidal particles is a ubiquitous phenomenon that would occur not only during the drying of paper coatings but also during consolidation of colloidal films containing particles of different sizes. This is of great importance in the control of surface compositions of nanocomposite coatings. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

This simple technique can be used to generate a diverse array of complex structures such as polymer–inorganic nanocomposites, aligned gold microwires and microwire networks, porous composite microfibres and biaxially aligned composite networks.

  abstract = {Hard carbon materials hold the most promising application among all anode materials for sodium-ion batteries because of the high storage capacity and good cycling stability. However, the low initial Coulombic efficiency limits their further commercialization. Herein, a new carbonization strategy is presented to prepare a cost-effective hard carbon material as anodes for sodium-ion batteries by pyrolyzing the interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) made from the mixture of biomass-derivative lignin and epoxy resin. By adjusting heat-treatment temperatures and the lignin/epoxy resin mass ratios, we can adjust the interlayer distance of carbon crystallites and defect sites for Sodium-ion storage, and thus obtain a hard carbon with a high capacity of 316 mAh g(-1), a high ICE of 82\%, and good rate capability (e.g., 161 mAh g(-1) at 300 mA g(-1)), all of which are superior to or comparable to those state-of-the-art carbons reported in literatures, by the help of a large interlayer distance of 3.95 angstrom. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared hard carbon anode versus air-stable O3-Na[Cu0.22Fe0.03Mn0.48]O-2 cathode is further demonstrated, while it presents a high ICE of 80\% and an energy density of 247 Wh kg(anode)(-1) (vs. hard carbon) with good cycle performance. These excellent properties verify that our synthetic strategy is feasible, scalable and can be extended into the fabrication of various carbon anode materials with anticipative microstructures for the economical SIBs.},

Graphite felt (GF) electrode was oxidized at a range of electrochemical oxidation degrees in H 2SO4 solution. The electrochemical performance of the treaded GF was discussed, and the law of the surface properties of GF which changed along with the electrochemical oxidation degree was proposed. The structure, composition, surface tension and electrochemical properties of the oxidized GF (OGF) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurements, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The GF oxidized at 560-840 mAh g-1 exhibited the best activity toward VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction, according with the highest COH and COOH content (ca. 34\%) on its surface. The mechanisms of VO 2+/VO2+ redox reaction on OGF were also discussed. VRB single cell with pristine GF and OGF as the electrode were test at various charge-discharge current densities, respectively. The columbic efficiency (CE), voltage efficiency (VE) and energy efficiency (EE) of the cell using OGF electrode are much higher than the cell using pristine GF, suggested that the electro-oxidation method is a promising technology for the activation of GF electrode. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The high potential at the cathode caused by the anode hydrogen-oxygen interface leads to the occurrence of carbon corrosion reactions during the startup and shutdown process. System strategies, including gas purge and auxiliary load, have been developed to alleviate the performance decay during startup and shutdown processes. Improper water management will cause local flooding to accelerate the carbon corrosion. Many novel flow fields have been proposed to solve water management problems, such as an optimized 3D flow field, baffle flow field and porous media flow field. The carbon corrosion under normal operation is not as serious as that under start-up and flooding, but it is serious enough to affect the later performance of the PEMFC after long-term operation. Varieties of new supports, such as mesoporous carbon, graphitized carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNF), and metal oxides, have been developed to improve the durability of the catalyst support. This review aims to provide a clear understanding of the carbon corrosion mechanisms, thereby helping researchers to prolong the lifetime of PEMFCs.},

Despite recent progress in addressing the various problems of sulfur cathodes, lithium sulfur batteries still exhibit significant capacity decay over cycling. Herein, we identify a new capacity fading mechanism of the sulfur cathodes, relating to LixS detachment from the carbon surface during the discharge process. This observation is confirmed by ex-situ transmission electron microscopy study and first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that this capacity fading mechanism can be overcome by introducing amphiphilic polymers to modify the carbon surface, rendering strong interactions between the nonpolar carbon and the polar LixS clusters. The modified sulfur cathode show excellent cycling performance with specific capacity close to 1180 mAh/g at C/5 current rate. Capacity retention of 80\% is achieved over 300 cycles at C/2.},

  abstract = {As the fraction of electricity generated from intermittent renewable sources (such as solar and wind) grows, developing reliable energy storage technologies to store electrical energy in large scale is of increasing importance. Redox flow batteries are now enjoying a renaissance and regarded as a leading technology in providing a well-balanced solution for current daunting challenges. In this article, state-of-the-art studies of the complex multicomponent transport phenomena in aqueous redox flow batteries, with a special emphasis on all-vanadium redox flow batteries, are reviewed and summarized. Rather than elaborating on the details of previous experimental and numerical investigations, this article highlights: i) the key transport issues in each battery's component that need to be tackled so that the rate capability and cycling stability of flow batteries can be significantly improved, ii) the basic mechanisms that control the active species/ion/electron transport behaviors in each battery's component, and iii) the key experimental and numerical findings regarding the correlations between the multicomponent transport processes and battery performance.},

  abstract = {Lithium-sulfur batteries have been widely nominated as one of the most promising next-generation electrochemical storage systems due to its low cost, high capacity and energy density. However, its practical application is still hindered by poor cycling lifetime, low Coulombic efficiency, instability and small scales. In the last decade, the electrochemical performances of the lithium-sulfur batteries have been improved by developing various novel nanoarchitectures as qualified hosts, and enhancing the sulfur loading with effective encapsulating strategies. The review summarizes the major sulfur cooperating strategies of cathodes based on background and latest progress of the lithium-sulfur batteries. The novel cooperating strategies of physical techniques and chemical synthesis techniques are discussed in detail. Based on the rich chemistry of sulfur, we paid more attention to the highlights of sulfur encapsulating strategies. Furthermore, the critical research directions in the coming future are proposed in the conclusion and outlook section.},

  abstract = {An effective and cheap way to optimize the oxygen electrocatalyst of the cathode for Li-O2 battery is to control the growth of a low amount of nanosized transition metal oxides on the surface of the carbon electrode. This approach combines the advantages of surface, interface, and nanosize engineering. In this work, a MnO2 content of about 9 wt \% is deposited on reduced graphene oxide (MnO2@rGO). The MnO2 particles grow uniformly on the rGO surface with a particle size smaller than 20 nm. The MnO2@rGO composites were applied as cathode catalysts in Li-O2 batteries, demonstrating an initial discharge capacity of 5139 mAh g-1 and a high capacity of 4262 mAh g-1 (80\% capacity retention) after 15 full discharge-charge cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. The outstanding performance can be attributed to the strong synergistic effect between the rGO framework and the nanosized MnO2 particles on its surface. The rGO framework possesses a porous multilayer structure, which provides an excellent electrical conductivity, promotes oxygen and ion diffusion, and provides storage space for the discharge products. The nanosized MnO2 possesses a high exposed surface, which enhances surface transport of LiO2 species and avoids the accumulation of discharge products on electrode surface. Furthermore, a transition between lithiated and nonlithiated manganese oxide during the discharge and charge processes was observed. This transition apparently helps to promote electron transfer between discharge products and the catalyst and thereby to reduce the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction.},

  abstract = {An effective route to enhance the volume ratio of active materials in a lithium-ion battery (LIB) or sodium-ion battery (NaB) consists in increasing the electrode thickness, that is, active mass loading, as it reduces the volume and weight fractions of the separator and current collectors in the cell. This approach also serves to reduce the battery cost, chiefly associated with the expensive polymeric separator. However, following the standard industrial coating process, the mechanically stable electrode can hardly exceed an active mass loading of about 30 mg cm −2 , corresponding to a nominal areal capacity around 6 mAh cm −2 due to the binder migration during the drying step. Herein, a straightforward manufacturing process based on a filtration technique is developed. It enables the design of LIB electrodes with a nominal areal capacity up to 20 mAh cm −2 . A pierced and serrated current collector allows at the same time both filtration and mechanical interlocking of the electrode layer. Cells assembled with such ultra-thick filtered electrodes exhibit very promising performances, thereby promoting the design of high-energy and low-cost LIBs and NaBs by a fast fabrication process.},
