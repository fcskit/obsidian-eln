Four components have been identified within the XPS N1s envelope through a range of ammonium bicarbonate electrolytic oxidation levels. These peaks were assigned to amide, aza, imide and protonated amine functionalities. The amide is identified as the major nitrogen functionality introduced by electrolytic oxidation, and analysis of a model carbon (pyrolytic graphite) surface has shown the electrolyte to be the source. The distribution of the nitrogen and oxygen within the surface (5 nm) of the fibre is qualitatively determined using angle-resolved XPS. The implication upon possible adhesion mechanisms between fibre and epoxy resin are considered using this new information.},

Electrochemical storage systems will be a solution of choice in many applications because of their localization flexibility, efficiency, scalability, and other appealing features. Among them redox flow batteries (RFBs) exhibit very high potential for several reasons, including power/ energy independent sizing, high efficiency, room temperature operation, and extremely long charge/ discharge cycle life. RFB technologies make use of different metal ion couples as reacting species. The best-researched and already commercially exploited types are all-vanadium redox batteries, but several research programs on other redox couples are underway in a number of countries. These programs aim at achieving major improvements resulting in more compact and cheaper systems, which can take the technology to a real breakthrough in stationary grid-connected applications.},

  abstract = {Improving the overall energy efficiency by reducing pumping power and improving flow distribution of electrolyte, is a major challenge for developers of flow batteries. The use of suitable channels can improve flow distribution through the electrodes and reduce flow resistance, hence reducing the energy consumption of the pumps. Although several studies of vanadium redox flow battery have proposed the use of bipolar plates with flow channels, similar to fuel cell designs, this paper presents the use of flow channels in the porous electrode as an alternative approach. Four types of electrodes with channels: rectangular open channel, interdigitated open cut channel, interdigitated circular poked channel and cross poked circular channels, are studied and compared with a conventional electrode without channels. Our study shows that interdigitated open channels can improve the overall energy efficiency up to 2.7\% due to improvement in flow distribution and pump power reduction while interdigitated poked channel can improve up to 2.5\% due to improvement in flow distribution.},

We experimentally demonstrate that the electrical contact resistance is predominately determined by the clamping force. It is observed that increasing the stress applied on the carbon felt, which is of high interest for the durability of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), has moreover a positive effect on their performance due to the reduced contact resistance. However, a simultaneously reduced porosity is also recorded and possibly detrimental to the mass transport of vanadium electrolyte. Moreover, the intrusion of carbon felts under compression is also characterized. Experimental results show that with the clamping force increases, both the porosity of the carbon felts underneath the rib and channel volume decrease, and this can be mainly attributed to the deformation of the carbon felts and resultant changed of the void volume as well as intrusion.},

  abstract = {As the fraction of electricity generation from intermittent renewable sources—such as solar or wind—grows, the ability to store large amounts of electrical energy is of increasing importance. Solid-electrode batteries maintain discharge at peak power for far too short a time to fully regulate wind or solar power output1,2. In contrast, flow batteries can independently scale the power (electrode area) and energy (arbitrarily large storage volume) components of the system by maintaining all of the electro-active species in fluid form3–5. Wide-scale utilization of flow batteries is, however, limited by the abundance and cost of these materials, particularly those using redox-active metals and precious-metal electrocatalysts6,7. Here we describe a class of energy storage materials that exploits the favourable chemical and electrochemical properties of a family of molecules known as quinones. The example we demonstrate is a metal-free flow battery based on the redox chemistry of 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS). AQDS undergoes extremely rapid and reversible two-electron twoproton reduction on a glassy carbon electrode in sulphuric acid. An aqueous flow battery with inexpensive carbon electrodes, combining the quinone/hydroquinone couple with the Br2/Br2 redox couple, yields a peak galvanic power density exceeding 0.6 W cm22 at 1.3 A cm22. Cycling of this quinone–bromide flow battery showed .99 per cent storage capacity retention per cycle. The organic anthraquinone species can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals8. This organic approach permits tuning of important properties such as the reduction potential and solubility by adding functional groups: for example, we demonstrate that the addition of two hydroxy groups to AQDS increases the open circuit potential of the cell by 11\% and we describe a pathway for further increases in cell voltage. The use of p-aromatic redox-active organic molecules instead of redox-active metals represents a new and promising direction for realizing massive electrical energy storage at greatly reduced cost.},

  abstract = {The progress of stabilization of two compositions of acrylic fibres with various orientations has been followed by a variety of techniques. The thermooxidative treatments for stabilization have been carried out in a continuous process and also in a batch process under free shrinkage, constant length and constant tension conditions. The morphological model of acrylic fibres consists of an alternating sequence of laterally ordered and laterally disordered regions along the fibre direction. This structure is consistent with the observations based on small-angle X-ray scattering of copper- impregnated precursor fibres and thermomechanical response, thermal stress development, calorimetry, wide- and small-angle X-ray scattering and sonic modu-lus measured at different extents of stabilization. Lateral as well as orientational order in these fibres can be increased markedly through a high-temperature deformation process prior to stabilization. An increase in perfection and extent of order is observed in the early stages of stabilization. There is also a simultaneous decrease in the orientation of the disordered phase at this stage and the extent of this decrease depends on the axial constraints imposed on the fibre. Little difference in the rate of stabilization is observed as measured by density or oxygen uptake for fibres with different extents of orientation, lateral order or restraint. Fibres containing itaconic add, a stabilization catalyst did show an increased rate of stabilization. Inferences have been drawn regarding additional research pertaining to achieving high order in precursor fibres, minimizing orientational relaxation during oxidative stabilization, and the techniques for monitoring the extents of the stabilization treatment and the changes in relevant morphological parameters.},

The NGS, in particular annealed at 900 °C, exhibited excellent catalytic performance in terms of electron transfer (ET) resistance (4.74 ± 0.51 and 7.27 ± 0.42 Ω for the anodic process and cathodic process, respectively) and reversibility (ΔE = 100 mV, Ipa/Ipc = 1.38 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1). Detailed research confirms that not the nitrogen doping level but the nitrogen type in the graphene sheets determines the catalytic activity. Among four types of nitrogen species doped into the graphene lattice including pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary nitrogen, and oxidic-N, quaternary nitrogen is verified as a catalytic active center for the [VO]2+/[VO2]+ couple reaction. A mechanism is proposed to explain the electrocatalytic performance of NGS for the [VO]2+/[VO2]+ couple reaction. The possible formation of a N–V transitional bonding state, which facilitates the ET between the outer electrode and reactant ions, is a key step for its high catalytic activity.},

Therefore, use of nitrogen-doped carbon is expected to increase the energy storage efficiency of VRBs.},

  abstract = {Employing electrolytes containing Bi3+, bismuth nanoparticles are synchronously electrodeposited onto the surface of a graphite felt electrode during operation of an allvanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). The influence of the Bi nanoparticles on the electrochemical performance of the VRFB is thoroughly investigated. It is confirmed that Bi is only present at the negative electrode and facilitates the redox reaction between V(II) and V(III). However, the Bi nanoparticles significantly improve the electrochemical performance of VRFB cells by enhancing the kinetics of the sluggish V(II)/V(III) redox reaction, especially under high power operation. The energy efficiency is increased by 11\% at high current density (150 mA·cm−2) owing to faster charge transfer as compared with one without Bi. The results suggest that using Bi nanoparticles in place of noble metals offers great promise as high-performance electrodes for VRFB application.},

  abstract = {Polystyrene (PS) surfaces were treated by electron-beam-generated plasmas in argon/oxygen, argon/nitrogen, and argon/sulfur hexafluoride environments. The resulting modifications of the polymer surface energy, morphology, and chemical composition were analyzed by a suite of complementary analytical techniques: contact angle goniometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS). The plasma treatments produced only minimal increases in the surface roughness while introducing the expected chemical modifications: oxygen-based after Ar/O2 plasma, oxygen- and nitrogen-based after Ar/N2 plasma, and fluorine-based after Ar/SF6 plasma. Fluorinated PS surfaces became hydrophobic and did not significantly change their properties over time. In contrast, polymer treated in Ar/O2 and Ar/N2 plasmas initially became hydrophilic but underwent hydrophobic recovery after 28 days of aging. The aromatic carbon chemistry in the top 1 nm of these aged surfaces clearly indicated that the hydrophobic recovery was produced by reorientation/diffusion of undamaged aromatic polymer fragments from the bulk rather than by contamination. Nondestructive depth profiles of aged plasma-treated PS films were reconstructed from parallel angle-resolved XPS (ARXPS) measurements using a maximum-entropy algorithm. The salient features of reconstructed profiles were confirmed by sputter profiles obtained with 200 eV Ar ions. Both types of depth profiles showed that the electron-beam-generated plasma modifications are confined to the topmost 3−4 nm of the polymer surface, while valence band measurements and unsaturated carbon signatures in ARXPS and REELS data indicated that much of the PS structure was preserved below 9 nm.},

The reduction of system costs is a major challenge in the realization of its widespread application. The high complexity of this technology requires a close linking of technologic and economic aspects in system cost assessment. The present review provides an extensive literature analysis with a focus on techno-economic assessment of VFB. Considered materials, system designs and modelling approaches are assessed and compared in order to present and evaluate the current status of system cost assessment in a transparent way. Systems in a range of 2 kW–50 MW providing energy for up to 150 h are covered in literature resulting in an immense range of specific total system costs of 564–12931 € kW−1 or 89–1738 € (kWh)−1. Based on the data from the reviewed studies, guide values of 650 € (kWh)−1 and 550 € (kWh)−1 for installed VFB systems in a power range of 10–1000 kW providing energy for 4 h and 8 h respectively are derived from literature. Moreover, the relevance of precision in the definition of scope and components for meaningful results of techno-economic assessments of VFB systems is pointed out.},

  abstract = {PAN-based carbon fibres carbonised at relatively low temperature, i.e. type III carbon fibres, were submitted to heat treatment at 2300 8C (GR) or oxidation in nitric acid. The samples were characterised by XPS, FTIR, wetting measurements, gas adsorption, elemental analysis and acid / base titration. While oxidation only slightly affects the nitrogen concentration, it produces an appreciable change in the nature of the chemical functions, namely the conversion of pyridine-type nitrogen and quaternary nitrogen into aliphatic functions. Oxidation treatment modifies all the material constituting the fibre, the oxygen concentration being about 1.5 times higher at the fibre external surface compared with the whole material. Three components (531.2, 532.6 and 533.8 eV) are clearly identified in the oxygen XPS peak, allowing a comparison to be made between the whole material and the external surface regarding chemical species. The acidic groups are mainly carboxyl. Fibres submitted to extensive oxidation also show a high basicity, attributed mainly to calcium carboxylate. Although the acidic and basic groups present in the whole material can be titrated with aqueous solutions, the fibres develop only a very small surface area and no microporosity as determined by krypton adsorption. The material may be viewed as a sponge, collapsed when dry but able to swell in water and developing a high cation-exchange capacity.},

  abstract = {Amino groups react rapidly with both isocyanates and epoxides. Thus, to prepare carbon fibers which might exhibit enhanced adhesion to both polyurethanes and epoxy resin matrices, attempts were made to introduce a high surface amine concentration onto high-strength carbon fibers (derived from PAN) by nitric acid oxidation followed by reaction with excess tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA). Fibers were oxidized with concentrated (70\%) nitric acid at 115 °C (20, 40, 60 and 90 minutes) to generate surface acidic functions, primarily carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups. These oxidized fibers were then reacted with TEPA at 190–200 °C to introduce surface-bound amino functions onto the surface via amide functions. The amide functions formed at the surface to graft TEPA to the surface. TEPA does not react with hydroxyl functions so hydroxyls remain on the surface. Decarboxylation of surface carboxyl groups was minor during the TEPA grafting. The quantity of surface-bound acidic and basic functions on these modified fiber surfaces was measured by NaOH and HCl uptake experiments. Then, methylene blue and metanil yellow dye adsorption experiments were employed to provide a measure of the surface area and both the surface density and steric availability of surface acidic and basic functions. The dye adsorption gave lower values of acidic and basic functional group surface concentrations than did NaOH/HCl uptake measurements. The number of acidic groups increased continuously with increasing oxidation times but after an initial jump in acidic groups per 100 Å2 at the start of the oxidation, the density of the surface acidic was approximately constant. Instead, the surface area increased, which accounted for the increase in total acidic groups. Nitrogen BET measurements were also performed and the BET surface areas were compared to those derived from dye adsorption experiments. Similarly, both HCl and metanil yellow adsorption measurements led to a value of 5.6 basic (amine) groups per 100 Å2 after reaction with TEPA. The results were consistent with an increase in surface area during nitric acid oxidation. About 52\% of the surface acidic functions, which were generated during nitric acid oxidations of 20–60 minutes, had reacted with TEPA. An average of 2.6 amino groups were introduced for each carboxyl group consumed in the reaction with TEPA. Thus substantial looping of TEPA occurs where more than one amino function of TEPA has formed an amide bond at the surface. The average ratio of the total amino groups introduced to the total amount of acidic groups present after nitric acid oxidation was about 1.35.},

The membrane crosslinked with 10\% of DVB content (PE/VBC(10)), 33μm in thickness, exhibits a low swelling ratio of 3.4\% and a water uptake of 23\%. In addition, the vanadium crossover rate of the PE/VBC(10) membrane is lower than Nafion 117 by 48\% at a similar electrical area resistance. Electrochemical properties of the PE/VBC membranes are examined in terms of the transport number and migration of ions as well as the electrical area resistance. Transport numbers for anions of the PE/VBC(10) membranes are 0.96 and 0.97 in NaCl and NaOH solutions, respectively. In acidic solutions of HCl and H2SO4, the membrane shows remarkably higher cation transport numbers of 0.20 and 0.72, which imply that the membrane allows high proton permeation and it is advantageous in VRFB operations. Furthermore, the migration of ions reveals reasonably low fluxes of other cations through the anion exchange membrane. Finally, the energy efficiency of the PE/VBC (10) membrane is 90.2\%, higher than Nafion 117 by 5.4\%.},

  abstract = {A gradient-pore-oriented graphite felt electrode was prepared by a facile one-step etching method, showing improved electrochemical activity and enhanced mass transport from nano- to micro-scale in flow batteries.           ,                             Developing high-performance electrodes that enable high redox activity and quick mass transport has been a central issue to enhance energy efficiency and current density in all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). In this work, a gradient-pore-oriented graphite felt (gradient-pore GF) electrode that contains pores from nano- to micro-scale was proposed by a facile one-step etching method. In this uniquely developed electrode, the microscale pores (∼20 μm) offer pathways for electrolyte flow, the nanoscale pores (∼20 nm) render sufficient active sites for electrochemical reactions, while the mesoscale pores (∼0.5 μm) as a “bridge” between nano and micro scale pores both facilitate the formation of active sites and reduce the electrolyte diffusion resistance. Thanks to the multiscale-pore-architectured structure, the high specific surface area (21.16 m               2               g               −1               ), and the abundant oxygen functional groups (25.69\%), gradient-pore GF has demonstrated high electrochemical activity towards vanadium ion redox reactions on both positive and negative sides. The battery assembled with the gradient-pore GF electrodes yields an energy efficiency as high as 79.74\% at the current density of 200 mA cm               −2               , 19.09\% higher than that with pristine graphite felt electrodes. Additionally, its energy efficiency can reach 63.41\% at high current densities up to 500 mA cm               −2               . This work provides an effective way to develop a high-performance electrode that possesses great potential applications in VRFBs and other battery systems.},

  abstract = {Porous graphite felts have been used as electrode materials for all-vanadium redox flow batteries due to their wide operating potential range, stability as both an anode and a cathode, and availability in high surface area. In this paper, the carbon felt was modified by pyrolysis of Ir reduced from H2IrCl6. ac impedance and steady-state polarization measurements showed that the Ir-modified materials have improved activity and lowered overpotential of the desired V(IV)/V(V) redox process. Ir-modification of carbon felt enhanced the electro-conductivity of electrode materials. The Ir-material, when coated on the graphite felt electrode surface, lowered the cell internal resistance. A test cell was assembled with the Ir-modified carbon felt as the activation layer of the positive electrode, the unmodified raw felt as the activation layer of the negative electrode. At an operating current density of 20 mA cm−2, a voltage efficiency of 87.5\% was achieved. The resistance of the cell using Ir-modified felt decreased 25\% compared to the cell using non-modified felt.},

  abstract = {The flow battery is a promising technology for large-scale storage of renewable energy owing to its unique advantages such as independence of power and energy capacity, scalability and versatility. The evaluation method is extremely important for the developments of both researches and applications of flow batteries. However, there is a lack of clear and uniform evaluation criteria in the open literature. The round-trip energy efficiency is commonly used to evaluate cell performance, whereas other different evaluating criteria may be suitable for different situations, with respective emphases. This paper reviews the development of performance evaluation criteria for redox flow batteries and clarifies the selection principle of evaluation criteria, stating that the system energy efficiency is the primary criterion, and power density or/and energy density are also vital evaluation criteria on the premise of maintaining high system energy efficiency for diverse types of redox flow batteries. The recent applications of these evaluation criteria on flow batteries are demonstrated afterwards. Finally, some exceptional conditions under what the system energy efficiency criterion is unsuitable are discussed, and emphasis is addressed on the new types of flow batteries. Applying a proper evaluation criterion helps to circumvent the remaining challenges of redox flow batteries, therefore, this review paper will be a useful guideline for the technology development and practical deployment of flow batteries.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel Organic Redox Flow Battery (ORBAT), for meeting the demanding requirements of cost, eco-friendliness, and durability for large-scale energy storage. ORBAT employs two different water-soluble organic redox couples on the positive and negative side of a flow battery. Redox couples such as quinones are particularly attractive for this application. No precious metal catalyst is needed because of the fast proton-coupled electron transfer processes. Furthermore, in acid media, the quinones exhibit good chemical stability. These properties render quinone-based redox couples very attractive for high-efficiency metal-free rechargeable batteries. We demonstrate the rechargeability of ORBAT with anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid or anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid on the negative side, and 1,2-dihydrobenzoquinone- 3,5-disulfonic acid on the positive side. The ORBAT cell uses a membrane-electrode assembly configuration similar to that used in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Such a battery can be charged and discharged multiple times at high faradaic efficiency without any noticeable degradation of performance. We show that solubility and mass transport properties of the reactants and products are paramount to achieving high current densities and high efficiency. The ORBAT configuration presents a unique opportunity for developing an inexpensive and sustainable metal-free rechargeable battery for large-scale electrical energy storage.},

Super activated carbon supported tungsten trioxide (WO3/SAC) is prepared via an impregnation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical performance of the prepared electrode is evaluated with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results show that WO3/SAC exhibits excellent electro-catalytic activity and kinetic reversibility toward the vanadium redox couples. By adding the WO3/SAC, the charge transfer resistances for both the positive and the negative reactions are significantly reduced. Using as prepared electrodes, the columbic efficiency (CE), voltage efficiency (VE) and energy efficiency (EE) of the vanadium redox flow battery at 50 mA cmÀ2 are 94.5\%, 85.2\% and 80.5\%, respectively, which are much higher than that of the cell assembled with pristine carbon paper electrodes.},

To utilize the nitrogen content in PAN, two steps of thermal treatment of PAN-coated graphite felts are performed; a PAN solution is coated on a graphite felt, and the sample is oxidized at 280 °C under the ambient atmosphere and carbonized at 900 °C under N2, consecutively. Through the two-step pyrolysis, nitrogen is successfully doped on the graphite felts, and the concentration of PAN solution is controlled to enhance the performance of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). With 4 wt \% of PAN coating solution, the electrode electrocatalytic activity is enhanced compared to that of a conventional electrode, and the voltage efficiency increases, resulting in higher energy efficiency under the various current densities. Especially at high current densities above 100 mA/cm2, the optimized nitrogen-doped electrode shows about 5\% higher voltage and energy efficiencies and a higher long-term stability in terms of efficiencies and capacity retention. This nitrogen-doping process with the same precursor for the electrode offers potential for employing nitrogen-doping on the conventional electrode materials in an inexpensive way.},

Carbon paper made of carbon fibres was hydroxylated ultrasonically with mixed acids (H2SO4/HNO3, VH2SO4 =VHNO3 = 3/1) in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for different time at 80 °C. The structure, composition, and electrochemical properties of the treated samples for positive and negative electrodes of VRFB were characterized with Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cell charge and discharge tests. The content of hydroxyl group changes from 3.8\% for the untreated sample to 14.3\% for the carbon paper treated in mixed acids for 10 h. The highly hydroxylated sample shows its high activity toward the redox reactions of V(II)/V(III) and V(IV)/V(V). The VRFB using the carbon paper treated for 8 h as the electrodes exhibits excellent performance under a current density of 10 mA cmÀ2. The average voltage efficiency reaches 91.3\%, and the average energy efficiency reaches 75.1\%. The mechanisms for the high hydroxylation of the carbon fibres with the mixed acids and the high activity of the treated sample toward the vanadium redoxs are discussed.},

Charge/discharge curves of the cell, positive and negative electrodes show that the rapid fall in cell voltage is due to the drop of positive potential caused by depletion of Br2 dissolved in the catholyte at the end of discharge. Cell voltage efficiency was limited by the relatively high internal ohmic resistance drop (iR drop). Polarization curves indicated that both NF and CF have excellent catalytic activity for the positive and negative redox reactions of PSB. The average energy efficiency of the single cell designed in this work could be as high as 77.2\% at 40 mA cm−2 during 48 charge-discharge cycles.},
